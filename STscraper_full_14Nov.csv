She was testifying on the second day of the trial of Azlin Arujunah and Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman, both 27, who are charged with murder with common intention to inflict severe scald injuries on their son. They each also face other charges relating to abusive acts, including pinching him with a pair of pliers, hitting him with a broom and confining him in a pet cage. In her autopsy report, Dr Chan wrote that she found that the boy had died due to severe scald injury. Partial-thickness burns, also known as second-degree burns, covered 75 per cent of his body, said Dr Chan. Such burns are ""very painful"" and ""go down to the blood vessels of the skin"", she told the court. As pictures of the boy's body, with patches of raw-looking skin, were shown on a screen, a stony-faced Azlin looked elsewhere, while Ridzuan bent forward and kept his head down. Dr Chan also elaborated on other injuries the boy suffered, such as wounds over his face and scalp, the fracture of his nasal bones, and bruising on his limbs and scalp. The soft tissue between the boy's lips and gums was torn, which she said would have been caused by a fall or punch of ""a considerable amount of force"". The pathologist said the injuries to the boy's head and face contributed to his death, as the bleeding affected his body's ability to fight the scald injury. Explaining how scald injury could lead to death, Dr Chan said that the loss of skin causes the body to lose fluid, and blood pressure to drop. This affects heart function and makes it harder for the victim to breathe. Infection also sets in, she said. ""It's a multi-organ involvement that leads to death."" In the week leading to his death on Oct 23, 2016, the boy was scalded with hot water on least four occasions by either Azlin, Ridzuan or both of them. Between Oct 15 and 17, Azlin grabbed the boy by the ankle and poured hot water over him repeatedly. Between Oct 17 and 19, both parents splashed cups of hot water on the boy. On Oct 21, Azlin chased the boy around the living room and threw cups of hot water at him. Ridzuan splashed hot water at the boy again the next day. Cross-examining Dr Chan on Wednesday, the respective lawyers acting for Azlin and Ridzuan sought to cast doubts that their clients were responsible for the fatal injury. Azlin's lawyer, Mr Terence Tan, questioned if the boy would be able to run around the living room if the earlier burns had been severe. Dr Chan replied that the boy was running ""for his life"" and that people have been known to run after being stabbed. Ridzuan's lawyer, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, noted that there were four incidents of scalding. He contended that it was not possible to tell which injury was the fatal one. He also suggested that the boy was suffering from pneumonia, which increased his risk of mortality . Questioned by Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wen Hsien, Dr Chan said there were no definitive signs of pneumonia when she examined his lungs. A week after the autopsy, a study of the boy's cells showed pneumonia, but she said it was ""patchy"" and ""minimal"", and did not cause his death. The trial continues. "

On the pretext of offering the 33-year-old woman a free ""Thai massage"", Tan Wai Luen got her to strip to her underwear and lie on a massage table, where he sexually assaulted her, prosecution told a district court on Wednesday (Nov 13), at the close of Tan's trial. Tan, 30, faces one charge of sexual assault by penetration. He has flatly denied sexually assaulting the woman throughout the trial. The woman, who cannot be named to protect her identity, had earlier testified to attending a free trial class at Encore Muay Thai on Oct 1, 2016, after she saw an advertisement on Facebook. Tan was the instructor for her class, which was attended by three other women whom she did not know. The woman was left alone with Tan after the class when the other three left, and he sat her down to discuss gym packages, said Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Kavita Uthrapathy in her closing submissions. But at some point during the discussion, Tan offered the victim a massage, and told her that he was the only one trained to do massages there, said DPP Kavita. The woman accepted. While he was massaging her inner thigh area, Tan sexually assaulted her, the DPP added. ""(He) took it out immediately when she turned around to look at him and shouted 'oi'. The accused did not apologise or say anything to her,"" said DPP Kavita. The massage then continued for about 10 minutes, and the woman left the gym thereafter. She realised the gym's main door was locked from the inside, so people would be prevented from entering the premises, and ""it dawned upon her that the entire ordeal was premeditated"", said DPP Kavita. The woman contacted another co-founder of the gym the next day about the incident, and the latter lodged a police report. Tan conceded at the start of the trial to accidentally touching the woman's genitals during the massage, the prosecutor said. He later went back on this and said ""it was impossible"" that he had touched her there at all, as he had ""stopped performing the massage on her at her lower thigh area"". DPP Kavita said: ""At the crux of the matter are the starkly opposing versions of events presented by the victim and the accused."" Both did not know each other prior to the incident, and there is no motive for the victim to make false allegations, she said. ""Set against this backdrop, the prosecution submits that the victim's evidence is reliable, unusually convincing and ought to be accorded due weight,"" said DPP Kavita. ""On the contrary, the accused's testimony is incredible, self-serving and rife with material inconsistencies."" The verdict of the trial is expected to be out next year. "

Both riders fell, with the pillion rider injuring his right knee, chest and left forearm. E-scooter rider Benjamin Neo Song Ya pleaded guilty in a district court on Wednesday (Nov 13) to one charge of causing hurt by a rash act. The car driver was given a stern warning for the illegal U-turn. The court heard that Neo was riding his e-scooter along Bedok North Street 2 at about 11.45pm on June 12 last year when he met with the accident. Neo was heading towards the entrance of a carpark, with Mr Gareth Soh, 17, riding pillion. At this point, Mr Ng Bao Hui, 34, was driving in front of Neo and Mr Soh. The rear camera footage of Mr Ng's car showed that Neo had seen Mr Ng slowing down to make a turn at the entrance of the carpark, said Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Tay Jingxi. Neo's e-scooter had no visible headlight, she added. ""The accused assumed that Ng was turning into the carpark entrance. The accused claims that he tried to slow down, but had problems with the e-scooter brake,"" said DPP Tay. But Mr Ng chose to make an illegal U-turn into the opposite direction of the road instead, she added. Neo failed to keep a proper lookout ahead and continued to proceed straight, colliding into the car's door as Mr Ng was executing the U-turn. ""The impact of the collision resulted in both the accused and the victim Gareth falling off the e-scooter,"" said DPP Tay. Both Neo and Mr Soh sought medical treatment for their injuries, she added. Mr Soh was given three days of medical leave for sustaining soft tissue injuries. Court documents do not state what Neo's injuries were. Mr Ng's car was dented with his right-side mirror ""ripped off"", said DPP Tay. Neo claimed that he sold the e-scooter after the accident. District Judge May Mesenas called for a probation pre-sentence report for Neo to assess his suitability for probation. Neo's sentencing will be heard in December. "

Sng Wee Hock, 46, faces 13 charges of cheating and 11 of forgery. Prosecutors told the court on the first day of the trial on Wednesday (Nov 13) that Sng made fraudulent Medisave claims between 2013 and 2014 for surgical procedures that he did not perform. Sng doctored photographs as ""proof"" of the procedures when the Health Ministry instigated an audit, said Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPP) Eugene Sng and Gerald Tan in opening submissions. He ran his own practice, WH Dental Surgeons, with branches in Punggol, Hougang and Seletar at the time of his alleged offences. Sng was the final decision-maker in the practice and in charge of submitting Medisave claims, said prosecutors. ""The charges against the accused arise in respect of his treatment of nine patients who had sought the surgical insertion of dental implants at WH Dental,"" said DPPs Sng and Tan. All nine were quoted a price of about $4,000 for each implant and many of them were told by Sng that the treatments were ""fully"" claimable with Medisave, said prosecutors. ""This is striking because the claim limits applicable for implant treatment were such that it was impossible for implants to be fully Medisave-claimable at the price charged by the accused,"" said the prosecution. Sng then allegedly made claims for two types of surgical treatment for all nine patients - a ""foreign body removal"" and ""autogenous bone grafts"". But Sng's patients did not recollect undergoing such procedures, said the prosecution, who said they will submit evidence to ""show that FBRs(foreign body removals) are very unusual procedures and that the prevalence of such treatment at WH Dental was striking"". Sng is also accused of lodging claims for implants that had already been inserted into his patients on prior occasions. In total, he claimed about $29,500 from Medisave through such methods. He doctored photographs to make it appear as though the surgical treatments had taken place, said prosecutors. In some instances, he added a ""single distinct white dot"" to purportedly show a ""foreign body"" prior to a procedure. There was also the ""augmentation of an image"" to make a tooth socket appear more distinct, purportedly to show a socket before the bone graft procedure. ""The accused's dishonest conduct was not isolated. Instead, it was a consistent course of conduct deliberately intended to subvert the rules on Medisave withdrawal limits and the Medisave audit process,"" said the prosecution. It was reported in June that Sng was suspended for four months and fined $18,000 for letting an oral health therapist fit braces on a patient and for not keeping proper notes. The trial will continue on Thursday (Nov 14). "

The syndicate is believed to be involved in illegal goods and service tax (GST) refund claims. The tax authority acquired powers of arrest under the amended GST Act, which came into effect on Jan 1. The amendment allows Iras' authorised officers to arrest, without warrant, any person they believe is making, attempting to make, or involved in making illegal tax refunds. The taxman's officers can also arrest anyone who possesses goods seized for these tax frauds, or anyone who has made such fraudulent claims in connection with any refund he got. Iras said on Wednesday that it had conducted islandwide raids on criminal syndicates suspected of being involved in a type of illegal GST refund claim called GST carousel fraud. The raids were done from Oct 23 to 24, and Tuesday to Wednesday, on 36 business entities in 73 locations, including Kallang Pudding, Tampines and Choa Chu Kang. About 200 electronic devices and business records were seized in the operation and 41 people are currently assisting Iras investigations. Of these people, 10 were arrested. Cases of GST carousel fraud often involve multiple companies and businesses selling and exporting goods to each other without paying GST. But they would still claim the GST paid on the exported goods, which is effectively seeking a refund of the GST amount that the tax authority never received. Iras said that it takes a serious view of such fraud and will not hesitate to take stern enforcement actions against offenders. It warned that anyone who wilfully evades or assists any other person to evade GST faces a penalty of up to three times the amount of the tax evaded and a fine of up to $10,000, and/or a jail term of up to seven years. Mr Lawrence Eng, the assistant commissioner of Iras' investigation and forensics division,said tax evaders are becoming more sophisticated. ""Today, we deal with more syndicated groups whose members may have been involved in past criminal activities. Some suspects can be very uncooperative; they try to destroy paper documents or refuse to hand over evidence,"" said Mr Eng. ""With our new powers of arrest, our investigators can be more effective in bringing the perpetrators to justice."" "

As a result of Isa disputing the details, Second Principal District Judge Victor Yeo rejected his earlier guilty plea and set aside his conviction. After the Singaporean pleaded guilty on Oct 23 to one count each of robbery and attempted aggravated rape, the court heard his past convictions, which involved multiple counts of robbery.

Corrective training is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. The maximum period is 14 years. After his release, Isa again committed robbery and was last sentenced in October 2002 to 14 years of preventive detention with the maximum 24 strokes of the cane.

The 1.05m-tall boy was also allegedly pinched with pliers on his thighs and buttocks, hit with various objects and scalded with hot water.

From June 2016, he suffered abuse allegedly at the hands of his parents while living with them and his siblings in a one-room flat in Toa Payoh. The boy developed a limp as a result of a misaligned kneecap he suffered after his mother Azlin allegedly hit him repeatedly with a broom over biscuits she found scattered on the kitchen floor. Azlin pushed the boy hard, causing his head to hit the wall and blood to flow from his head because he refused to answer a question. Ridzuan then punched the boy in the face, causing him to bleed profusely from the nose. In the week leading up to his death - between Oct 15 and 22 that year - the boy was scalded with hot water on at least four occasions, causing him to suffer severe scald injury that led to his eventual death. The day before he died, the boy was hit on his head, hands and legs allegedly by Ridzuan, the father, using a broom, because he had refused to take off his shorts to have a shower. Ridzuan then allegedly threw several cups of hot water at his son's legs and body, causing the child to shout ""don't want, don't want"" in Malay. The prosecution team said the boy crouched over as Ridzuan poured hot water over his son's back and calf area, and the child fell forward onto the bathroom floor and stopped moving. Upon his admission to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, he was found to be in a critical condition with symptoms such as low body temperature and low blood pressure. He also had second-to third-degree burns, dehydration, acute kidney injury, multiple facial wounds and a broken nose, and demonstrated isolated speech delay.

He faces four charges in all and allegedly committed these offences at the Ocean Financial Centre in Collyer Quay in April and October 2017. He cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the woman's identity. On the second day of the trial yesterday, the court heard that the lawyer, who is now working for another firm, gave a statement in November 2017 to investigation officer (IO) Thanabalan Kothandapani in which he admitted his alleged offences. This incriminating statement could potentially be submitted to the court as evidence against him. He is now contesting its admissibility, stating the IO had offered to close the case if he agreed to conditions that included admitting to the offences and apologising to the parties involved. When queried by District Judge Samuel Chua yesterday, the man said: ""First, there was a guarantee that by doing so, there would be no court proceedings. Second, to my mind, there was something like a settlement negotiation. People do apologise and admit to things which they didn't do in order to procure an amicable closure to matters."" The judge also asked the lawyer why he saw the need to give an apology to exculpate himself. He replied: ""(It's because) of the offer that the IO had given me - that the matter would not go to the AGC (Attorney-General's Chambers) if I did all these things. ""I simply wanted the matter to be closed so I could live my life.""

Former Aetos Security Management employee Chai Chong Sien pilfered the monies on multiple occasions between March and June this year, while his colleagues were busy replenishing the cash in the ATMs. On Tuesday (Nov 12), the 34-year-old was sentenced to nine months' jail after he pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust. Chai was part of a three-man team charged with topping up the cash in ATMs belonging to DBS bank, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Thiam Jia Min told the court. He was commonly deployed as a driver in the team, and his two teammates were responsible for transporting cash cassettes to the ATMs. As the designated replenishment officer and guardsman, Chai's teammates were required to don body-worn cameras to ensure they did not steal cash while handling the cassettes. But Chai, as the driver, did not have to as he was not supposed to be handling the cash cassettes. According to Aetos' standard operating procedure, the designated replenishment officer has to call the command centre for a code to open the van's vault in which the cash cassettes are stored, said DPP Thiam. ""As this process was troublesome and time-consuming, a common practice on the ground was for the RO (replenishment officer) to pre-load multiple cash cassettes out of the vault onto the passenger seats of the van,"" she said. This meant that Chai, as the driver, was often left alone to ""safeguard"" the van and preloaded cash cassettes, while the other two were replenishing cash, she said. ""The accused would use some force to knock on the cassette shutter, which would then open and allow him access to the cash contained inside,"" said DPP Thiam. Chai's actions only came to light when DBS found a significant shortfall of cash in its ATMs, which ""prompted an internal investigation by Aetos"", she said. Chai spent $2,900 of the stolen monies to cover personal expenses. The police seized the remaining $20,100, which had been hidden under Chai's bed in his rented home. No restitution has been made for the sum spent. A spokesman for Aetos said Chai is no longer with the company, adding that Aetos has zero tolerance towards such acts of misconduct. ""We will also continue to strengthen all processes to ensure full compliance and security of the utmost standards,"" said the spokesman. For his crime, Chai could have been jailed up to 15 years and fined. "

It later resurfaced in October. The police said on Tuesday that it received a report last Thursday in relation to the fake website. A 52-year-old woman told the police that $3,300 had been transferred from her bank account without her consent. She had received a call from someone claiming to be from the SPF who alleged she was involved in illegal activities. The call was then transferred to someone claiming to be a law enforcement officer in China, who then directed her to a website resembling the SPF website. The victim was then instructed to key in her bank account details, password and one-time password. The woman suspected that she was scammed after receiving a text message alerting her that money had been transferred from her account into an overseas account. The police are investigating the case. They said that victims of this scam typically receive calls from scammers, claiming that the victims are the holders of bank accounts with large amounts of money.

He faces four charges in all and allegedly committed these offences at the Ocean Financial Centre in Collyer Quay in April and October 2017. He cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the woman's identity. On the second day of the trial on Tuesday (Nov 12), the court heard that the lawyer, who is now working for another firm, gave a statement in November 2017 to investigation officer (IO) Thanabalan Kothandapani in which he admitted his alleged offences. This incriminating statement could potentially be submitted to the court as evidence against him. He is now contesting its admissibility, stating that the IO had offered to close the case if he agreed to conditions including admitting the offences and apologising to the parties involved. When queried by District Judge Samuel Chua on Tuesday, the man said: ""First, there was a guarantee that by doing so, there would be no court proceedings. ""Second, to my mind, there was something like a settlement negotiation. People do apologise and admit to things which they didn't do in order to procure an amicable closure to matters."" The judge also asked the lawyer why he saw the need to give an apology to exculpate himself. He replied: ""(It's because) of the offer that the IO had given me - that the matter would not go to the AGC (Attorney-General's Chambers) if I did all these things. ""I simply wanted the matter to be closed so I could live my life."" He also said he wanted to avoid the ""whole process"" of going on trial, adding that if he faced charges, ""the matter would have appeared in major news outlets"", which would have affected his mother's health. The man, who is represented by defence lawyer Tan Hee Joek, did not give the details about his mother's condition on Tuesday in court. According to court documents, he allegedly pressed his thigh against his then colleague's upper arm and used his mobile phone to snap pictures of the woman's underwear on Oct 11, 2017. He is also accused of snapping pictures of her chest and undergarments on two occasions in April that year.  The man is now out on bail of $15,000 and his pre-trial conference will be held on Nov 26. In a statement, Drew & Napier said that it has a “strict zero-tolerance policy” towards misconduct of any nature.  Its spokesman  said: “Our colleagues work hard to maintain a supportive and respectful work environment with an open-door policy. We are fully committed to ensuring that every single member of our firm feels safe, and that reported cases of misconduct, sexual or otherwise, are responded to swiftly.  “Appropriate steps were taken when the allegations came to light. As the matter is before the courts, we cannot comment further at this time.” If convicted of insulting the woman's modesty, the man can be jailed for up to a year and fined for each charge. Offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. "

The High Court awarded the sum to Smile Inc Dental Surgeons in judgment grounds yesterday, after assessing the damages payable by OP3 International for breaches that led the clinic to close for three extended periods, between 2013 and 2015. Smile had sued OP3 for alleged defective design and construction of the clinic and in 2017, it was found liable for the three periods totalling 321 days. The judge in yesterday's decision grounds assessed the amount OP3 had to pay after a five-day hearing that stretched over several months. The periods of closure comprised 50 days in 2013 for delayed completion of fitting works, 51 days in 2014 and another 220 days in 2015 after two floods in 2014 caused by OP3's failure ""to ensure the works were designed and executed in a manner that was fit for its intended purpose"", the judge said. As a result of the second flood, Smile found mould had grown again on the same walls of the filing room in the clinic on July 21, 2014. On July 29, 2014, Smile closed the clinic, which was repossessed by the landlord in March 2015. Justice Chan Seng Onn said Smile's claims were ""aplenty, ranging from its expenses flowing from the removal and storage of equipment and items in the Suntec clinic, to expenses it had incurred to remedy the impact of the floods"". He noted Smile also claimed for loss of profits suffered during the three ""blackout periods"", among other things, and the total sum sought was more than $1,312,407.87. In an 84-page judgment, the judge dealt with each item claimed grouped into four categories and assessed sums for each of them. These included $80,573 for flood investigation and remediation costs, and $151,384 for wasted depreciation expenses from March 2015 till the end of the lease in September 2016. <strong>$1.3m</strong> Total sum Smile Inc Dental Surgeons was claiming in its lawsuit against OP3 International. The court rejected Smile's claim for $265,399.38 for ""loss of management time and expense"" allegedly suffered due to the first and second floods. But it awarded the biggest single item, loss of patient revenue, as a result of the blackout periods. The judge estimated the average patient revenue per day for the Suntec clinic was $2,076.91 per operational day based on the $454,843.44 revenue earned for the 219 days it operated. Hence, the total patient revenue deemed lost for 321 blackout days came to $666,688. From this sum, the judge deducted $400,013 for variable expenses based on an average ratio of expense to revenue for an indicated period and found the sum payable for patient revenue loss to be $266,675. But lawyers Vijai Parwani and Nicholas Chandra argued that Smile suffered no patient revenue loss during the blackout periods as they were diverted to Smile's other dental clinics. Smile, represented by lawyers Ho Chien Mien and Samantha Teong, countered, among other things, that the patients were not automatically diverted to Smile's other clinics when the Suntec outlet was closed. Justice Chan accepted there was at least some diversion to Smile's other clinics but the actual proportion ""is an entirely different question"". The judge rejected the argument that there was no loss suffered by Smile during the repeated closures, noting that the diversion effect would be cancelled out by the ""opposing disruption effect"" on the clinic caused by the repeated and intermittent closures. Justice Chan allowed $87,432 to OP3 in its counterclaim for the unpaid balance of renovation work done to be deducted from the amount payable to Smile. The total sum eventually due to Smile would be $534,189. "

In what is believed to be the first case of its kind, the 66-year-old had pleaded guilty in October last year to 20 counts of mischief. Another 266 similar charges were considered during sentencing. As a result of Tay swopping the tags on 286 pieces of luggage, the two carriers had to pay compensation totalling more than $42,000 to 221 affected passengers. At the time of the offences - between November 2016 and February 2017 - Tay was employed by industrial equipment supplier Lian Cheng Contracting, a subcontractor of the Changi Airport Group. He is no longer working at the airport. The court heard that he was suffering from major depressive disorder during that period. A hearing was held to determine if there was a causal link between the offences and his condition. Yesterday, District Judge Jasvender Kaur said she found that his major depressive disorder ""had not caused or significantly contributed to the offending"". She added that she accepted evidence from the prosecution's psychiatrist Tor Phern Chern, who had earlier testified that patients who suffer depression in relation to their work would ""experience impairment"" in areas such as performing their tasks properly. The judge added: ""In the case of the accused, he remarkably continued to go to work diligently during the entire period of offending. ""The accused stopped swopping the luggage tags immediately upon his transfer in February 2017 to an easier job.

During the hearing, Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiam Jia Min said the machine would stop working several times a day. Whenever there was a breakdown, Tay had to move the bags to another X-ray machine about 6m away. Tay told his supervisor that it was physically tiring work. However, as the company's manpower was limited at the time, the firm did not deploy additional staff. His offences came to light after the airlines told ground handling company Sats that some of their passengers' baggage tags had been tampered with. Sats made a police report on Dec 7, 2016. "

She was also ordered to compensate her former maid, Ms Than Than Soe, $1,000 instead of $38,541. Bong was  During the eight-day trial last year, the court heard that Bong hit the Myanmar national on the cheek thrice with a glass bottle of medicated oil because she was upset by the smell of the oil that the maid used to ease her headache. The court also heard that prior to this assault on May 17, Bong abused the maid two or three times a week, often punching her in the eyes. The maid became blind in her left eye due to, among other things, retinal detachment, and her right eye was found with severe injuries. She was 27 when she was employed by Bong in 2013, and had perfect eyesight.

Bong's lawyers, Mr Sui Yi Siong and Ms Flora Koh, sought a fine instead of a jail term, arguing that the district judge erred in relying on the evidence of Ms Than Than Soe's eye injuries during sentencing. Justice Chua Lee Ming found that the sentence imposed by the district judge was ""manifestly excessive"", as there was no evidence that the May 17 incident directly caused Ms Than Than Soe's eye injuries. In fact, a medical professional testified that the maid's eye injuries, including the retinal detachment, was likely to have occurred before the May 17 incident, a point which the prosecutors acknowledged. The only evidence of injury caused from that incident was the contusion on the victim's face, said Justice Chua. He added that the compensation paid to Ms Than Than Soe should be $1,000 as the original amount accounted for the medical expenses for her eyes. Justice Chua said that he had full sympathy for Ms Than Than Soe who has suffered ""such horrific injuries"". ""However, Madam Bong was not charged for any of the previous assaults.

Judge Audrey Lim, in reversing a trademark registrar's decision, found that Lutong Enterprise Corp's mark of three sloping lines in an inverted pyramid with a circle at one end, is visually similar to Adidas' mark, and people may be confused by the two. The Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, Ms See Tho Sok Yee, ruled last year that the two marks were ""visually dissimilar"". She found that the Adidas mark resembled a pyramid, while Lutong's gave the impression of something ""en pointe"", and can be seen as a shuttlecock. Adidas, represented by Drew and Napier lawyers Yvonne Tang, Jaswin Kaur Khosa and Edsmond Cheong, appealed against her decision. At the appeal hearing last Monday, Judge Lim disagreed and said the two marks share common key components, namely that both comprised three trapezoids of staggering heights that are in the shape of a triangle. While there are some differences, ""it is assumed in a mark-for-mark analysis that the average consumer has 'imperfect recollection', and hence the contesting marks are not to be compared or assessed side by side"", Judge Lim added, according to court papers obtained by The Straits Times. Both companies also sell goods that are similar, if not identical, said the judge, adding that the items are ""relatively inexpensive and purchased often without great attention or scrutiny given to them"". The two companies produce and sell clothing, footwear and other assorted items. People may buy Lutong's products assuming they originate from Adidas, and expect the quality of Lutong's goods to be comparable with those of Adidas, she said. ""The connection is likely to damage Adidas' interest,"" she added. "

Victims were cheated of at least $194,000. The police verified that there were no such lucky draws conducted by Lazada and Shopee. For the 278 scam cases, police said that a two-week operation was conducted between Oct 29 and Thursday by the Commercial Affairs Department and seven police divisions. A total of 140 scammers and money mules were rounded up - 80 men and 60 women aged between 14 and 70 - and they are assisting with further investigations over their suspected involvement in cheating or money laundering. In the lucky draw scams, victims were contacted by scammers impersonating their friends or followers on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. The impersonators would ask victims for their contact numbers and images of their credit or debit cards, on the pretence of signing them up for lucky draws conducted by Lazada and Shopee. The victims were also told to share the one-time passwords that they received. They realised they had been cheated after discovering unauthorised transactions made on their accounts. Those found guilty of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. Those found guilty of money laundering can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $500,000 or both.

The speed limit for motorists in the area was not mentioned in court documents. Kalaimani was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles in Singapore for five years after pleading guilty to causing Madam Mok Fei Chen's death by negligent driving.

She suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The other woman, Ms Ernie Shelvic Sheldon, 21, suffered injuries, including a right pelvis fracture and a lacerated liver. She was treated at the National University Hospital along with five of the other 10 passengers injured in the crash. The other five were treated at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Pei Wei said Kalaimani started the trip in Malaysia at around 2am on Feb 26 this year.

The DPP added that he continued going at a ""fast speed"" while driving up the ramp at the Tuas Checkpoint later that morning.

The ruse targeting SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has been described as the largest fraud against a public institution here. The SSG scheme pays subsidies to local businesses when they send an employee for skills training courses with registered training providers if certain conditions are met. This subsidy reimburses some of the course fees and is paid either to the training provider or the firm, depending on the claim method used. The scammers used nine Singapore-registered businesses that submitted 8,386 fraudulent course fee grant applications and a corresponding 8,391 claims to SSG between May and October 2017. The court heard they were ""dormant"" firms with ""no on-going business"". About $39.9 million was disbursed by SSG to these entities, Deputy Public Prosecutor Gordon Lim said. In 2012, Vincent got to know one of the alleged masterminds, Ng Cheng Kwee, 43. Court papers state Ng approached him five years later to find someone to encash cheques in exchange for an unspecified sum. Vincent accepted the offer and approached Manickam. On Sept 12 and 19, 2017, Vincent received the cheques from Ng and handed them to Manickam, who cashed them at Maybank branches. The latter passed the cash to Vincent and received $20. Vincent, who was not informed about the source of the funds, handed Ng more than $1 million over the two days. Ng, whose case is pending, then gave him $3,000. The court heard Vincent continued committing similar offences even though he ""had reasonable grounds to believe that the cheques and encashed monies represented proceeds from criminal conduct"".

The former auxiliary police officer, 28, is currently serving a jail term of 19 years and 11 months. Srihari said he became acquainted with the boyfriend online, who later invited him to take part in a threesome. The first encounter was on April 29, 2016. The boyfriend led Srihari into a room at Hotel 81 Bugis while the woman, now 28 years old, was bound and blindfolded. The boyfriend then had sex with her before Srihari took over. But doubts crept in on the second occasion on Aug 7, 2016. Srihari had been invited again by the boyfriend to take part in a tryst at M Social Hotel in Robertson Quay. He said that prior to the meeting, the man had sent him a text message, telling him to be on ""standby"" that weekend. Srihari, who had attained his operationally ready date status in May that year, replied: ""Oh damn, for sure."" Explaining his reaction in court, Srihari said: ""If he's asking me back a second time, then clearly they are cool with it. So here I was, coming back a second time."" When Srihari arrived at M Social Hotel at around 2am, the boyfriend met him at the lift lobby and told him to wait outside the room, he recalled. When he was given the cue to enter, Srihari saw the man's then girlfriend bound and blindfolded. As Srihari began to perform penetrative sex on the woman, she started to move, lifting her head and removing her blindfold and untying herself, he recalled. ""He started to gesture wildly at me to get out and leave. It was a very, very sharp, deliberate movement,"" said Srihari. As Srihari left the room, he said he heard the woman saying: ""Who's that?"" At that point, he began to feel doubt, he said. ""I felt terrible that he asked me to leave suddenly because at that point, it began to dawn on me that this was not a sexual fantasy that he wanted to share with me, but that he just wanted to use me for his sexual fantasy,"" said Srihari. ""A small bit of doubt on whether she consented started festering in my mind, and I started to feel panicky. I felt really bad,"" he added. When asked by his lawyer, Mr Trent Ng from Kalco Law, why he had been ""so confident"" that the woman had given her consent to the threesome, Srihari said: ""I'm a lot fatter than he is. The feel of my body would have been very different, from moving on and off the bed, her legs touching my back."" He added: ""The way everything played out and how it worked, it genuinely led me to believe that both of them had talked this through."" The trial continues. "

It was declared in its import declaration as a “toolbox”, which prompted checks that found it contained 5,800 illegal sexual enhancement tablets. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said it is investigating the incident. The Straits Times understands that no one has yet to be arrested or fined.

On Friday (Nov 8), the man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the girl's identity, was sentenced to 12 years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane. Around 2015, the man, who is divorced with a son from his previous marriage, got into a relationship with the girl's 39-year-old mother, and later moved in with her and her family at their Housing Board flat. His son would sometimes stay with him at the flat. In 2017, sometime between the night of March 27 and the early hours of March 28, the man smoked methamphetamine, also known as Ice. He then tried to have sex with the girl's mother twice, but was dissatisfied with her response to him each time, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Zu Zhao.

Later that night, the girl asked her mother if she could leave the house with her the next day.

The next morning, the girl began to cry as her mother was about to leave the flat. Sensing that her daughter was afraid of something, the woman decided to take leave that day to stay with the girl. Two days later, on March 30, the girl told her mother about the incident. The mother confronted her boyfriend immediately, but he denied the girl's account. Not believing him, the mother took her daughter to Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre and lodged a police report against the man.

Neo Wei Chia, 42, was sentenced yesterday to five days' jail after pleading guilty to causing grievous hurt to the boy by riding his device in a negligent manner. The boy, who has since recovered, cannot be named as he is a minor. Shortly before the accident, the child was riding pillion on his grandmother's bicycle along the park connector around 6.30pm on April 12 last year. He then told his grandmother that he wanted to get off as they approached his home at the Riversails condominium in Upper Serangoon. She continued cycling while he ran along the left side of the park connector near an entrance to the condominium. Deputy Public Prosecutor R. Arvindren said Neo was riding his e-scooter ""speedily"" around the same time and did not slow down. Court documents did not reveal his speed. The DPP told District Judge Ong Hian Sun: ""The victim then suddenly crossed over from the left side of the said park connector to the right. ""The accused failed to keep a proper lookout for the victim... The accused applied the emergency brakes of his electric scooter. However, as the accused had braked too late, (his) electric scooter collided with the back of the victim's body."" Both Neo and the boy fell to the ground. The child was then seen bleeding from his left ear. His grandmother immediately came forward while Neo remained at the scene with the boy. The child was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, where he was found with injuries including fractures to his skull and abrasions on his left limbs. DPP Arvindren urged the judge to sentence Neo to at least a week's jail, adding: ""There must be a sufficient measure of deterrence to ensure that PMD (personal mobility device) users who share the same space as pedestrians take extra care to ensure that they are doing so in a lawful and safe manner."" Defence lawyer K. Jayakumar Naidu said his client is ""deeply remorseful"" and that the boy had ""dashed out"" from the grass verge. He told the judge: ""We are urging this court to consider a fine. But due to his financial disposition, we urge (this court) to impose a one-week custodial sentence."" In the latest and toughest measure yet to address safety concerns, e-scooters have been banned from footpaths since Tuesday. This means that e-scooters will be confined to only 440km of cycling paths islandwide, instead of the 5,500km of footpaths that riders could use before. For now, the authorities will mainly issue warning letters to errant riders, but a zero-tolerance approach will be taken from next year. Those caught flouting the rules can be fined up to $2,000 and/or jailed for up to three months if convicted. For causing grievous hurt to the boy by riding the e-scooter in a negligent manner, Neo could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. "

Justice Lee said the evidence adduced by Mr Toh was sufficient to infer that such an agreement existed. The judge, however, found that Mr Toh had breached his employment contract by hiring a tutor who was still employed by TuitionGenius. A further hearing will be held to determine whether the company was entitled to damages. "

The boy, who has since recovered, cannot be named as he is a minor. Shortly before the accident, the child was riding pillion on his grandmother's bicycle along the park connector at around 6.30pm on April 12 last year. He then told his grandmother that he wanted to get off as they approached his home at the Riversails condominium in Upper Serangoon. She continued cycling after that while he ran along the left side of the park connector near an entrance to the condominium. Deputy Public Prosecutor R. Arvindren said that Neo was riding his e-scooter ""speedily"" at around the same time and did not slow down. Court documents did not reveal his speed. The DPP told District Judge Ong Hian Sun: ""The victim then suddenly crossed over from the left side of the said park connector to the right. ""The accused failed to keep a proper lookout for the victim... The accused applied the emergency brakes of his electric scooter. However, as the accused had braked too late, (his) electric scooter collided with the back of the victim's body."" Both Neo and the boy fell to the ground. The child was then seen bleeding from his left ear. His grandmother immediately came forward while Neo remained at the scene with the boy. The child was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital where he was found with injuries including fractures to his skull and abrasions on his left limbs. DPP Arvindren had urged Judge Ong to sentence Neo to at least a week's jail, adding: ""There must be a sufficient measure of deterrence to ensure that PMD (personal mobility device) users who share the same space as pedestrians take extra care to ensure that they are doing so in a lawful and safe manner."" Defence lawyer K. Jayakumar Naidu said that his client is ""deeply remorseful"" and that the boy had ""dashed out"" from the grass verge. He told the judge: ""We are urging this court to consider a fine. But due to his financial disposition, we urge (this court) to impose a one-week custodial sentence."" In the latest and toughest measure yet to address safety concerns, e-scooters have been banned from footpaths from Tuesday. This means that e-scooters will be confined to only 440km of cycling paths islandwide, instead of the 5,500km of footpaths users could use before. For now, the authorities will mainly issue warning letters to errant riders, but a zero-tolerance approach will be taken from next year. Those caught flouting the rules can be fined up to $2,000 and/or jailed for up to three months if convicted. For causing grievous hurt to the boy by riding the e-scooter in a negligent manner, Neo could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. "

Filipina Fallorina Joann Marie Gayares later shouted at the child before flicking his head with her finger. Her acts were captured on a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera and the boys' mother alerted the police after viewing the clip. Gayares, 25, was sentenced on Thursday (Nov 7) to four weeks' jail after pleading guilty to one count of ill-treating the boy. A similar charge involving his twin brother was considered during sentencing. The children cannot be named due to a gag order to protect their identities. The boys' father had employed Gayares last year to work for the family in their home in the northern part of Singapore. There were several CCTV cameras installed in the home, and the boys' mother decided to view the clips more frequently as she suspected that Gayares had been handling the twins in a rough manner. On April 15 this year, the mother told Gayares that she and her husband would not be coming home for dinner. Through a mobile application, the mother viewed the live CCTV footage at around 6pm where she saw Gayares feeding her sons in the living room. Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Chan said that while feeding the children, Gayares wiped the victim's mouth roughly with a towel, pushing his mouth upwards. She then poked the boy's chest once, the DPP added. After the boy dribbled some food onto his T-shirt, the maid stared at the child, who flinched when she pinched his left ear. The DPP added: ""The accused then raised her elbow and gestured towards the victim as though she were going to hit him, causing the victim to flinch again."" After that, she leaned in close to the boy and shouted: ""Swallow."" She also flicked the boy's head with her finger before telling him: ""Come here, I change you."" She then walked out of the living room with the child following her. The boys' parents returned home immediately after viewing the footage and confronted Gayares. The mother alerted the police at around 7pm and the boy was later taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital. No injuries were found on him and he did not complain of any pain. Gayares, who was unrepresented in court on Thursday, pleaded for a light sentence. For ill-treating the boy, she could have been jailed for up to four years and fined up to $4,000. "

He later abandoned his BMW to escape on foot and is still at large. The police said on Thursday that they were called following two hit-and-run accidents along Geylang Bahru Road and St George’s Road on Wednesday morning. “Preliminary investigations revealed that an LTA official had spotted a vehicle suspected of displaying a false licence plate on his car along Geylang Bahru Road. However, the driver did not stop as instructed and drove off,” police said. The police added that the car first hit a taxi in Geylang Bahru Road towards Bendemeer Road and later collided with another parked car at Block 22 St George’s Road before the male driver abandoned the car and fled. In a two-minute video posted on YouTube on Thursday, a man is seen jumping out of a moving white BMW car before it hits a black parked car. Soon after, an LTA official arrives on a motorcycle with its blinker lights flashing. When contacted for more information on the offence of switching number plates, the LTA referred The Straits Times to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan’s reply to a Parliamentary question in July where he said: “Between 2017 and 2018, there were six persons convicted of displaying false number plates. Three of them received jail sentences of four to nine weeks, while the other three had fines imposed.” He added that it is an offence to display false number plates in Singapore and anyone found doing so may be punished with a fine of up to $5,000 or a jail sentence of up to 12 months, or both. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" data-fid=""255571"" data-media-element=""1"" height=""405"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/imgonline-com-ua-frameblurred-awxlfl9udszkcu.jpg?itok=vM6HKXcd&amp;timestamp=1573229422"" title="""" typeof=""Image"" width=""720""/><br/><figcaption>Police are looking for the man shown in the image below to assist in investigations.

If the girls were reluctant, ""Vacinta"" would coax them into taking the job, adding there was a ""stringent vetting process"" as only clients who were ""young, non-ugly and rich men"", and who had undergone regular health checks were allowed. If the girls revealed that they were underage, they were told ""age was not an issue"". The offender, Angelo Anwyll Goh Hao-Yi, as ""Vacinta"", would then arrange for the girls to meet him for sex. Goh's offences involved eight girls who were then between 13 and 17 years old. He had unprotected sexual intercourse with most of the teenagers. He even filmed some of his encounters with them. The 34-year-old Singaporean was sentenced on Thursday (Nov 7) to four years and 10 months' jail. He had pleaded guilty to nine counts of having sex with minors. He also admitted to one count each of making obscene films and having commercial sex with the 17-year-old girl . Fifteen other charges, mainly for similar offences, were considered during sentencing. He committed his offences between September 2016 and April last year. The court heard that some time before May 2016, Goh created a Facebook account under the name ""Vacinta Koh"", who was purportedly below 20 years old - a profile similar to his intended targets. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Pei Wei said: ""Before creating this fake Facebook account, the accused previously attempted to engage girls for sex using several male profiles under different false names but did not receive any response. He therefore decided to use a female profile."" Goh then found young girls on Facebook and sent friend requests to the ones he liked using this fake account. ""When a girl accepted his friend request, he would message the girl using Facebook Messenger and ask her if she was interested in earning quick money of between $100 and $ 200 per hour."" When the girl asked what the job entailed, Goh , as ""Vacinta"", would inform her that she would need to work as a ""part-time girlfriend"" or ""escort"". ""Vacinta"" also told the girl that ""she"" too was working as one and could recommend ""nice clients"" to the victim. The DPP told District Judge Edgar Foo: ""If the girl agreed, the accused would purport to arrange for them to meet a client who was, in truth, the accused. ""The accused as Vacinta also asked the victims to introduce their friends if they were interested in engaging in sex for money."" ""Vacinta also cautioned the victims not to let anyone else know about the 'job'."" The court heard that if a girl agreed to wear her school uniform, she would be paid an additional $10. A girl who agreed to be filmed would be given $20 extra. When Goh met the girls in person for sex, he would take them to places where they would not be detected. These included his car and his home in Poh Huat Terrace near Yio Chu Kang Road when no one else was around Court documents did not reveal how the offences came to light, but Goh was arrested on April 2 last year. He is now out on bail of $30,000 and will surrender himself at the State Courts on Nov 14 to begin serving his sentence. Offenders convicted of having commercial sex with a girl below 18 years old can be jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

On the third day of the trial on Wednesday (Nov 6) in the State Courts, the prosecution argued that Teo had selectively chosen to remember only certain things. Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang said: ""You recall some snippets, but you can't recall the assault... I put it to you that this break in your memory is incredible and very convenient."" She added: ""You locked her in the room and punched her. It is not a random assault. You specifically targeted and punched her face. This is a deliberate and cold-blooded attack."" Teo disagreed, insisting he could not remember details, except that they had sex and argued, and then waking up in a cell. He later vaguely remembered Ms Lim offering him zopiclone, a sleeping pill she was taking for her bipolar disorder. He added that he found out the extent of her injuries only later, and said: ""I was quite shocked and horrified."" Teo said they had gone out for dinner and drinks the night before the incident and she had also performed oral sex on him while he was driving home. DPP Phang said that having oral sex while he was driving would have required coordination and focus. She also argued that as a doctor, Teo would have known he should not take the medicine Ms Lim offered. But Teo said: ""When I'm intoxicated, I have very little control and I'm pretty open to suggestions."" Teo gave an example of how he had taken the anti-psychotic drug quetiapine after Ms Lim offered it to him but then raged at her over the phone. He also claimed he had told Ms Lim he was terrified of taking sleeping pills as he already was an alcoholic. Teo's father, Mr Teo Kim Poh, 64, who also took the stand on Wednesday, said he was woken by Ms Lim's crying. He heard an argument and said he knocked on the door and said: ""Clarence, open the door, if not I will call the police."" But there was no response. He called the police after Ms Lim told him she was not all right. He said he also suggested to the police to break down the door as the equipment needed was taking some time to arrive. The police took two to three tries to break down the door. According to him, Teo was lying on the bed with no response or resistance. The older Mr Teo also said his son, when drunk, had never been violent towards him or his daughter. He would mostly keep to himself. If found guilty of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Teo could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. He could be jailed for up to a year, fined a maximum $3,000, or both if convicted of wrongfully confining his ex-girlfriend. Teo is out on bail of $15,000. The trial is expected to resume in January next year. "

After defaulting on his national service (NS) obligations for four years, eight months and 30 days, Jonathan Lee Han Wen, 22, returned to Singapore on Sept 3 last year and enlisted a month later. Lee, who is now serving his full-time NS with the Singapore Armed Forces, was sentenced yesterday to nine weeks in jail after pleading guilty to four charges under the Enlistment Act. He was not in possession of a valid exit permit between 2013 and last year, the court heard. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Lim said Lee's mother, Ms Lim Kim Lian, is a Singaporean, and his father a British citizen and Hong Kong permanent resident. Lee and his family left for Hong Kong on Jan 19, 1997. The DPP added that Lee was subjected to the Enlistment Act on June 17, 2013, when he turned 161/2 years old. He registered for NS about two months later. Between Aug 26 and Sept 12 that year, Ms Lim corresponded by e-mail with CMPB for a renewal of her son's exit permit. The DPP said: ""Ms Lim was informed of the need for a bond, in the form of a bank guarantee or deed, to the amount of $75,000 to be furnished before such EP (exit permit) can be issued. The return date of the deed was extended multiple times for Ms Lim or the accused's family to furnish the bond. ""Such bond was not furnished. A valid EP was, accordingly, not issued."" Ms Lim also applied several times for NS deferment for her son, pending a renunciation of his Singapore citizenship. The applications were rejected, with the CMPB explaining to her that male Singapore citizens have to fulfil their full-time NS obligations before requests to renounce their citizenship can be considered. Lee went to Lancaster University for his course, which started in September 2014. He sent an e-mail to CMPB about a year later to ask for a deferment, but was rejected. He obtained his bachelor's degree on July 10 last year and returned to Singapore about two months later. In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Defence said all male Singapore citizens and PRs have a duty to serve NS, adding that it is important that NS has the support and commitment of all Singaporeans.

This emerged on the first day of the trial of Srihari Mahendran, 23, on 10 charges of various sexual offences - including four for rape - against the woman in 2016. Testifying as a prosecution witness, the woman's former boy-friend said: ""His legs were hairier than mine, he was asking if it might give (the game) away."" The former boyfriend's solution: pantyhose. The 28-year-old former auxiliary police officer is serving a jail term of 19 years and 11 months. He cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the identity of the woman, now 28. He pleaded guilty last year to abetting Srihari to rape and sexually assault the victim. The woman, who allowed herself to be blindfolded and bound during sex with her then boyfriend, said she believed that she was having sex with him at all times. On the night of April 29, 2016, the man let Srihari into a room at Hotel 81 Bugis while she was bound and blindfolded. He had sex with her before Srihari took over. Later that year on Aug 7, he again had Srihari join them in a tryst at M Social Hotel in Robertson Quay. The woman eventually realised someone else was in the room and removed her blindfold and untied herself as Srihari made his escape. Both men were arrested at the hotel. Srihari's DNA was later found in swabs taken from her body. Yesterday, the former boyfriend told the court how he hatched a plan with Srihari to fulfil his fantasy of watching another man have sex with his girlfriend. The couple began engaging in soft bondage practices after watching the movie 50 Shades Of Grey to ""spice things up"", but she rejected his idea of having a threesome. In 2015, he began chatting on-line with Srihari, then 20, on sexual matters. He said he told Srihari that his girlfriend was ""not okay"" with a threesome and that she could not know that another man was having sex with her. ""(Srihari's) sense of keen eagerness in the idea made me discuss with him more about how this would happen,"" he said. He asked Srihari to describe himself, and the latter said he was of average build and of Arab descent. He also asked for a picture of the lower part of Srihari's body. ""If he looks okay or better than me, if (the victim) found out, she won't be too angry about it,"" he said. The two men discussed precautions to ensure she could not tell that another person was having sex with her. These included using pantyhose, maintaining silence and for Srihari to refrain from smoking. When Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Yiwen asked if he knew that his plan was an offence, the man replied: ""At the time, it wasn't at the top of my head."" The man saw Srihari for the first time on April 29, 2016, outside the hotel. ""He looked nothing like how he described himself,"" he said. However, he did not abort the plan. ""It was already in the pipeline, it was just a matter of making it happen or not."" He described how he let Srihari into the room after tying the woman's hands, blindfolding her, putting pantyhose on her and turning on the TV to mask any sounds. He recorded Srihari having sex with the woman on video, and even made sounds of moaning to reinforce the illusion that he was the one carrying out the acts. The prosecution will be admitting the recordings as well as text messages between the two men to prove that Srihari was cognisant of the plan for him to have sex with the victim without her knowledge. The trial continues. "

He will also be placed under an Electronic Monitoring Scheme for a period of six months or until national service enlistment, whichever is earlier. Meanwhile, his friend Mohamed Erzan Taib Zohri, 19, was sentenced to 15 months' probation. Under the conditions of the probation orders, both teenagers are required to stay indoors from 10pm to 6am. Raziq must perform 150 hours of community service, while Erzan will have to do so for 100 hours. Both teenagers' parents were also bonded for $5,000 each to ensure their good behaviour. The pair had been riding their e-scooters along Pasir Ris Drive 1 towards Loyang Avenue at about 8.20pm on March 16, from their respective homes to play sepak takraw. Raziq was travelling along the left lane of the two-lane road, when he approached a pedestrian crossing, controlled by a traffic light, near Block 516 Pasir Ris Street 52. When he was about five car-lengths from the crossing, Raziq noticed the traffic light was red but did not slow down or stop his e-scooter. Instead, he continued riding the device across the pedestrian crossing at a speed of about 30kmh. At the same time, the victim, Mr Cheah Thie How, 28, was also riding his e-scooter across the same pedestrian crossing while the green man was in his favour. At this point, the traffic light had already been showing red for over 25 seconds, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sarah Ong. Raziq's device then collided with Mr Cheah's e-scooter, causing the latter to be flung to the ground. Erzan, who was incidentally riding a short distance behind Raziq, was also travelling at a speed of about 30kmh and did not slow down or stop at the traffic light crossing despite it showing red. Erzan beat the red light, saw the collision, and did not stop to render any assistance. The incident was witnessed by a driver, Mr Jason Chua Chang Han, 36, whose car had stopped at the pedestrian crossing when the collision took place. It was captured by his in-car camera. After the collision, Raziq checked on the damage to his e-scooter, then left the scene without sharing his particulars with Mr Cheah. He then met Erzan and his girlfriend at a nearby Housing Board block. Mr Chua located Raziq and told him not to run away and that he had video footage of the incident, but the teenager trio fled the scene. The next day at about 6pm, Raziq presented himself at Hougang Neighbourhood Police Centre and told the police about his involvement in the collision. He added that Erzan had been present at the incident. Meanwhile, Mr Cheah was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital by an ambulance. He suffered bruises on his shoulder, chest and legs, as well as a fractured toe. He was given 14 days of hospitalisation leave and light duty from March 30 to May 10, and his medical bills amounted to nearly $2,200. "

Teo testified that he later told a police officer: ""I don't remember anything."" On the second day of his trial, Teo also told District Judge Toh Han Li that his drinking problem had cost him his job twice.

Teo allegedly caused grievous hurt to Ms Lim at his Redhill flat between 2am and 4.12am on Aug 27, 2017. She suffered injuries including fractures to her face and left little finger.

They include anti-psychotic quetiapine, mood stabiliser lamotrigine and zopiclone - a type of sleeping pill. Teo said: ""We told each other about our mental health issues from the start... we supported each other."" The court heard that the couple went pub-hopping and had alcoholic drinks on Aug 26, 2017 before returning to his Redhill flat in the wee hours the next day. He recalled having sex with her in his room and his ""next memory"" was waking up in a cell. He added: ""I recall people handcuffing me... I didn't know where I was. Someone told me I was in Police Cantonment Complex."" Teo said that after he was bailed out, he went to his room and saw a bottle of zopiclone belonging to Ms Lim. He told the court that he then ""vaguely"" recalled that she had offered him the medication. But the court heard that no tests had been done on him to check for the presence of the medication in his system. Teo added that on an earlier occasion, she had asked him to take a tablet and, according to her, he became like a ""peaceful cat"" after that. He testified that once during their relationship, Ms Lim had also passed him quetiapine to ""calm"" him down but he ended up ""raging"" at her over the phone soon after. Ms Lim, however, told the court on Monday: ""Never in my life had I given Clarence medication to eat."" On Tuesday, Teo said that he had stopped drinking since October 2017 and attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He was also seeking treatment to address his drinking problem, the court heard. Teo is now out on bail of $15,000 and the trial resumes on Wednesday. If convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. "

""USE would also work with industry stakeholders where the need arises, such as escalating cases to the Police Licensing & Regulatory Department, or helping the officers lodge police reports."" Singapore was gripped last week by a viral video showing a resident at the Eight Riversuites condominium in Whampoa verbally abusing a security officer over the Deepavali weekend. <a href=""https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/man-filmed-verbally-abusing-security-officer-at-condo-files-police-report"" target=""_blank"">Mr Erramalli Ramesh was caught on video</a> In the video, Mr Erramalli could be heard telling the security officers that he bought his apartment for $1.5 million, adding: ""You're putting my visitors in such a position. You're telling me for Diwali, they can't visit after 11 o'clock?"" Mr Raymond Chin, general secretary of the USE, which is an affiliate of the National Trades Union Congress, said the union is happy to offer its mediation services to help officers deal with the unfair abuse they face when executing their duties as prescribed by the law. ""We stand united with our officers and will not hesitate to do our utmost to protect their welfare and dignity,"" he added. SAS president Raj Joshua Thomas said the e-mail helpline provides an avenue for officers to send complaints and videos on abuse, so that their grievances can be dealt with legally, and without having to get into trouble for doxxing and harassment. ""The Office of the SAS Counsel will act on complaints received to advise officers and if necessary, arrange for representation for officers who are abused or have other legal issues,"" he added. ACSA president Robert Wiener said the association and its members fully supported the cause to protect security officers who might face abuse in the course of their work. ""Security officers work round the clock to protect life and property. They should be given the due respect and not be abused for their noble discharge of their duties. Respect security officers, they stay vigilant so that you can sleep in peace,"" he added. In its statement on Tuesday, the SIC also said it would continue to advocate against abuse by distributing its decal for display at all sites as well as through outreach activities to recognise the work of security officers. The SIC also referred to a poll conducted earlier this year by the USE, which involved 52 security officers, with about 73 per cent reporting some form of abuse, verbal or physical, in their work. The SIC said it believes the numbers are larger, but officers either do not want to report them or do not know of the recourse available. It added that according to the Private Security Industry Act, security officers serve the purposes of guarding, screening, surveying and controlling traffic and serve as bodyguards or bouncers. Most of these functions require them to advise the public of the conditions and rules put in place by the managing agent or site representatives. ""Should the officer fail to execute the rules, they or their employer are often faced with financial penalties,"" said the SIC. To minimise the risk of abuse of security officers, the council encourages stakeholders in the industry, including service buyers, to support the transformation of the security profession. It suggests that buyers begin using Outcome Based Contracting (OBC), which involves buyers adjusting their requirements to expected performance levels, rather than fixed amounts of manpower for output levels. It also suggests the buyers begin proper Threat, Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (TVRA), which is a process of identifying and analysing the risks against critical assets of a site. The SIC also advises buyers to install the right security technology at the sites according to the TVRA analysis and to deploy manpower that have been trained to use the technology. ""This will minimise the risk of abuse, and also nullify the practice of using liquidated damages to compel security agencies and their officers to enforce poorly devised rules, as is the common practice today,"" it added.

He was not in possession of a valid exit permit between 2013 and last year, the court heard. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Lim said that Lee's mother, Ms Lim Kim Lian, is a Singaporean while his father is a British citizen and a Hong Kong permanent resident. Lee and his family had left for Hong Kong on Jan 19, 1997. He was aware of his NS obligations in Singapore even when he was still in primary school. DPP Lim said: ""The accused understands from Ms Lim that the latter chose to give birth to him in Singapore. At that time, the sovereignty over the (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) was about to be transferred to the People's Republic of China. ""Hence, Ms Lim desired for the accused to have a Singapore citizenship which allows him to return to Singapore as a place of relative stability."" The DPP added that Lee became subject to the Enlistment Act on June 17, 2013, when he turned 16½ years old. He then registered for NS about two months later. Between Aug 26 and Sept 12 that year, Ms Lim corresponded by e-mail with the CMPB for a renewal of her son's exit permit. The DPP said: ""Ms Lim was informed of the need for a bond, in the form of a bank guarantee or deed, to the amount of $75,000 to be furnished before such EP (exit permit) can be issued. ""The return date of the deed was extended multiple times for Ms Lim or the accused's family to furnish the bond. Such bond was not furnished. A valid EP was accordingly not issued."" On her son's behalf, Ms Lim also applied several times for NS deferment, pending a renunciation of his Singapore citizenship. The applications were rejected, with the CMPB explaining to her that male Singapore citizens have to fulfil their full-time NS obligations before requests to renounce their citizenship can be considered. Lee went to Lancaster University for his foundation course, which started in September 2014, and he sent an e-mail to the CMPB about a year later to ask for a deferment. Even though it rejected his request, he decided to return to Singapore to serve his NS only after completing his studies. He obtained his bachelor's degree on July 10 last year and returned to Singapore about two months later. He reported to the CMPB on Sept 4 last year and finally enlisted the following month. In his mitigation, defence lawyer Ashwin Ganapathy told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim that his client has ""little or no links to Singapore"". The lawyer also said that Lee had voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and wishes to return to Hong Kong to ""start life afresh"". For each charge under the Act, Lee could have been jailed for up to three years and fined up to $10,000. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said it takes a firm stand against those who commit offences under the Enlistment Act. It added that since the High Court set out the sentencing framework for NS defaulters in 2017, 13 defaulters, including Lee, have been sentenced to imprisonment. “All male Singapore citizens and permanent residents (PRs) have a duty to serve NS and it is important that NS has the support and commitment of all Singaporeans. To achieve this, we have to adhere to the fundamental principles of universality and equity in NS,"" said Mindef.  It added: “If we allow Singapore Citizens or PRs who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined.” "

The books, which are the first of their kind, are titled Practitioners' Guide On Damages Awarded For Defamation Cases In Singapore, and Law And Practice Of Tribunals In Singapore. They were written by judges from the State Courts, with contributions from other individuals in the legal industry. The first book details the range of damages awarded for defamation cases, and contains case summaries that set out the factors considered by the courts in arriving at different awards of damages, as well as the outcome of appeals. It also outlines the general principles of defamation law and the State Courts' pre-action protocol for defamation actions that took effect in September last year to encourage pre-action settlements. Speaking at the launch, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said the tort of defamation is complex, technical and frequently misunderstood and, as a result, defamation proceedings are often protracted and poorly argued. ""Many plaintiffs also struggle to accurately assess the likely outcome and the amount of damages. In this context... the guide provides welcome clarification on the tort of defamation and how it is adjudicated in Singapore,"" he said. Examples of cases that are illustrated in the guide include slander against a company, professional and community leader, as well as libel against a political leader and an office bearer. These include the 2015 defamation suit brought by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong against blogger Roy Ngerng, and a 2017 case involving WhatsApp messages sent to committee members and office bearers of the Mahabodhi Monastery. The second book explains the legal principles governing tribunals, how tribunal hearings should be conducted and how tribunals should be managed. It also provides guidance for new tribunals and established ones, and best practices for tribunals to consider adopting. <strong>WHAT:</strong> • Practitioners' Guide On Damages Awarded For Defamation Cases In Singapore • Law And Practice Of Tribunals In Singapore <strong>WHERE: </strong> <strong>PRICE: </strong> The book was drawn from the State Courts' experience in managing their tribunals for small claims, community disputes and employment claims. ""Tribunals play a critical role in the administration of justice in Singapore because of the number and the spectrum of the dispute that they deal with,"" said the Chief Justice. ""The authors (of this book) have deliberately avoided the use of technical or complex jargon to ensure that the text remains highly accessible to laypersons,"" he added. Both books can be bought online at  At the event, Chief Justice Menon also witnessed the signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with the law schools of the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU) and Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). The MOUs with the NUS and SMU law schools formalise the Clinical Clerkship Programme that was piloted two years ago with NUS and extended to SMU this year to give law students the opportunity to experience judicial work. Students under the joint NUS-SMU law module are supervised by two senior judges of the State Courts - the deputy presiding judge and the senior district judge. The MOU with the SUSS School of Law establishes the Legal Clerkship Programme to provide students with practical training and clinical experience by allowing them to prepare court documents and present them in a mock court hearing, and to develop their written and oral advocacy skills.

A district court heard yesterday that the insurance firms or agents would then allegedly receive accreditation from the embassy in return. James Yeo Siew Liang, 48, who represented AIG Asia-Pacific Insurance and Liberty Insurance, is accused of agreeing to be part of the plan. A search on the General Insurance Association of Singapore's website reveals no information about him. He is accused of giving more than $21,000 in bribes to the translator, Abdul Aziz Mohamed Hanib, 64. Yeo is also said to have given more than $71,000 to the labour attache, Agus Ramdhany Machjumi, who is no longer in Singapore. The court heard that Aziz allegedly found Yeo through an intermediary, Benjamin Chow Tuck Keong, 56, who was a corporate development director of a company dealing with organic products. According to court documents, Chow did not give or receive any money. Aziz, Yeo and Chow are on trial, with Aziz and Yeo facing more than 15 graft-related charges each, and Chow, one. On the first day of the trial yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Alan Loh said that since Feb 1 last year, the embassy in Singapore has made it compulsory for all local employers hiring Indonesian maids to buy a $6,000 performance bond. This allows the embassy to call on the bond for the benefit of the maids in the event of any purported breaches of employment conditions by the employer. Mr Loh added: ""This was clearly a lucrative business for general insurers if they received accreditation from the Indonesian Embassy as they could collect a $70 premium for each (performance bond) issued in respect of an estimated 120,000 (Indonesian foreign domestic workers) in Singapore. ""The insurers could seek reimbursement from the employers in the event that a (performance bond) was called on."" This, in turn, allowed the insurers to pay their agents a ""generous"" 45 per cent of the premiums earned for each bond, and was a ""win-win for insurers and their agents"", the court heard. DPP Loh told District Judge Ong Luan Tze that between February and June last year, AIG and Liberty sold more than 5,700 performance bonds. Yeo allegedly gave the bribes without the two firms' knowledge. There is also no evidence that the Indonesian Embassy knew or approved of Agus purportedly receiving a share of such commissions. The trial resumes today. "

The housewife, who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at the time of the attack on April 9 last year, pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Prosecutors told the court that because her mental condition substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts, the charge against her was reduced, even though there was clear evidence for the original murder charge. She sobbed quietly as her lawyer told the High Court in mitigation that while the woman's mental condition was no excuse for her actions, his client struggled after the death of her two children and was unaware of her psychiatric condition. In sentencing, Judicial Commissioner Vincent Hoong described the case as ""deeply unfortunate"", and said he recognised that the woman was in a difficult situation. However, the judge noted that she had carried out an unprovoked attack on a defenceless child, and the sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution must take centre stage. The parties involved cannot be named due to a gag order. The court heard that the woman suffered the death of her four-month-old baby in 2011, and lost an infant who was born premature in February last year. On April 9 last year, at the family's two-room flat, she became angry with the victim for defaecating on a towel in the bedroom after her bath. She carried the girl back to the toilet to wash up, and along the way, some faeces dropped on the floor. The woman scolded her daughter as she washed her, and the girl started to cry. After cleaning the girl, she was further angered when the girl did not obey her instructions to go to the bedroom. She pulled the toddler into the room and, after dressing her, lifted the girl to shoulder level and threw her to the floor forcefully. This made the girl cry louder. The woman then told her daughter to clean up her toys in the living room, but when she noticed the girl standing still and crying, she lifted her up again and threw her to the floor. As the girl lay on the floor, the woman kicked her. When the child did not respond, she became alarmed and tried to resuscitate the girl. At this time, her 41-year-old husband phoned her, and she lied that their daughter was having a bout of fits. The girl, bleeding from the mouth, was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Hospital staff made a police report, but the woman maintained that the toddler had a seizure and ""fell out"" of her grasp. On April 11 last year, she finally admitted what she had done. The toddler, who suffered multiple skull fractures and abdominal injuries, was declared brain dead on April 14 that year, and taken off life support on April 17. The woman was diagnosed with major depressive disorder by an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist, who said the condition had its onset before the death of her premature infant. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Zhou Yihong argued for a jail term of at least seven years. ""The attack on the toddler was vicious, sustained and unprovoked,"" she argued. ""All (the victim) had done was what every two-year-old would have done, which was cry and misbehave,"" said the DPP. Defence counsel Anand Nalachandran urged the court not to look at the incident in isolation, seeking a jail term of five years. The woman was treated in 2007 when she slit her wrists, and in 2009, she was referred to IMH for attempted suicide. ""Our client was struggling under the immense agony of undiagnosed mental illness for several years after losing two children - and tragically, another child has been wrenched away. ""She will bear this unimaginable pain and regret for the remainder of her days,"" said Mr Nalachandran. The defence counsel submitted a letter in which her husband hoped for her return as soon as possible. "

Clarence Teo Shun Jie, 35, who works as a locum - or stand-in doctor - at clinics, is also accused of causing a fracture to her left little finger. He allegedly caused grievous hurt to Ms Rachel Lim En Hui at his Redhill flat between 2am and 4.12am on Aug 27, 2017. Teo is also accused of wrongfully confining Ms Lim, 27, in his bedroom and preventing her from leaving that morning. The couple are no longer together. Three other assault charges involving her have been stood down for now and may be dealt with at a later date. He allegedly committed these three offences on March 12 and 30, 2017. Portions of her police report made on April 1 that year were read out in court yesterday. Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang told the court that Ms Lim got to know Teo online through a dating application called ""Coffee Meets Bagel"" in late February 2017. According to the report, they were together on March 12 that year when he allegedly brought up her past relationships before punching her. He apologised the next day and she forgave him. But he allegedly struck her again in his car on March 30. Ms Lim, who works in the communications industry, testified in court yesterday. She told District Judge Toh Han Li that she went out with Teo for a night of merrymaking on Aug 26, 2017, and returned to his home in the wee hours the next day. DPPs Phang and Amanda Sum said in their opening statement: ""However, the accused became enraged and turned aggressive when she expressed reluctance to have sexual intercourse with him. When she tried to leave the room to escape from him, he pursued her, forced her back into the room, and locked the door. ""This was followed by a violent assault wherein the accused punched the victim's face repeatedly with great force, and hit the victim's head against the wall."" The DPPs said in their statement that Teo's father, who lived in the flat, alerted the police at 4.12am. Teo was arrested and Ms Lim was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where she was warded for 21 days. Teo is now out on bail of $15,000 and the trial resumes today. "

Singaporean Ed Chen Junyuan, who pleaded guilty last month, was the first person to be convicted of the offence of flying a drone without a permit. He flew the drone within 5km of the airbase. It was spotted around Punggol Field Walk at around 9.30pm on June 26. Yesterday, District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam said that general deterrence was needed because of the rise in the number of such cases, adding that a stiff fine would deter others from committing a similar offence. Deputy Public Prosecutor Dwayne Lum had earlier told the court that Chen should not be let off with ""a slap on the wrist"", as he was piloting the drone without the required permit and with prior knowledge that an airbase was nearby. DPP Lum, who urged the judge to sentence Chen to a fine of $3,000, added: ""Unregulated operation of drones, especially within close proximity to airbases, poses serious consequences for aircraft safety. ""In addition, unregulated drone operation also poses a safety risk especially if done in an irresponsible fashion, endangering not just aircraft but persons and property."" Defence lawyer Josephus Tan, however, had pleaded for the court to impose a fine of between $500 and $1,000. Last month, Mr Tan told the court that Chen was operating a drone without electronic ""geofencing"" technology, which allows for clear demarcation of no-fly zones. The lawyer added that without this technology, Chen would not have been likely to know exactly how close he was to the airbase. Mr Tan also argued that Chen flew the drone only at a height of 6m, around two storeys of an HDB block, and this could not have posed any danger to air traffic control or military aircraft. He had said: ""There was no actual harm whatsoever and minimal potential harm. (Chen's) case is therefore wholly unlike the two drone incursions at Changi Airport in June 2019, whereby runway operations and flights were indeed delayed."" First-time offenders caught flying a drone without a valid permit could be fined up to $20,000. Repeat offenders could be jailed for up to 15 months and fined up to $40,000. "

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said the jib, or horizontal beam, of the tower crane had failed during a lifting operation. Workers told The Straits Times that the two men were on the ground when they were hit by falling material. The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for help at about 8.50am. The Indian national was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic. The injured worker, a 35-year-old from Bangladesh, was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) by ambulance. Workers at the site told ST that the crane was carrying around 300kg of scaffolding material when it ""suddenly"" gave way. Most were perplexed as to why part of the crane had collapsed. ""For construction (cranes), 300kg is considered very light,"" said a worker who declined to be named, adding that the cranes can lift materials weighing tonnes. They said the injured worker had suffered a ""slight injury"" to his leg. The crane operator was unharmed, they added. A resident whose apartment faces the construction site said she heard a loud ""boom"" in the area at about 8.40am. The 33-year-old consultant saw the operator climb down from the driver's cabin about 20 minutes later. An MOM spokesman said the dead man was employed by LKT Contractors and the injured worker's employer is BHCC Construction. Both firms are subcontractors for the project, and could not be reached for comment. However, a spokesman for the development's main contractor, Kajima Overseas Asia (Singapore), said a team is looking to help the families of the workers, and will submit insurance claims for the workers and their families. Workers were constructing a 17-storey rehabilitation complex, with more than 500 beds, which will be part of TTSH. A spokesman for the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the casualties. Work has been halted at the site, and MOH is working with the main contractor to render assistance to the dead worker's family, as well as to the injured worker, said the spokesman. The police and MOM are investigating the incident. Since 2015, there have been 37 ""dangerous occurrences"" involving mobile or tower cranes, said MOM. Five cases were reported this year, including this incident, said an MOM spokesman. The Indian national is the first reported fatality of a workplace incident involving a mobile or tower crane since 2015. "

The books, which are the first of their kind, are titled Practitioners' Guide On Damages Awarded For Defamation Cases In Singapore, and Law And Practice Of Tribunals In Singapore. They were written by judges from the State Courts, with contributions from other individuals in the legal industry. The first book details the range of damages awarded for defamation cases, and contains case summaries that set out the factors considered by the courts in arriving at different awards of damages, as well as the outcome of appeals. It also outlines the general principles of defamation law, and the State Courts' pre-action protocol for defamation actions that took effect in September last year to encourage pre-action settlements. Speaking at the launch, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said the tort of defamation is complex, technical and frequently misunderstood, and as a result, defamation proceedings are often protracted and poorly argued. ""Many plaintiffs also struggle to accurately assess the likely outcome and the amount of damages. In this context... the guide provides welcome clarification on the tort of defamation, and how it is adjudicated in Singapore,"" he said. Examples of cases that are illustrated in the guide include slander against a company, professional and community leader, as well as libel against a political leader and an office-bearer. These include the 2015 defamation suit brought by  The second book explains the legal principles governing tribunals, how tribunal hearings should be conducted and how tribunals should be managed. It also provides guidance for new tribunals and established ones, and best practices for tribunals to consider adopting. The book was drawn from the State Courts' experience in managing their tribunals for small claims, community disputes and employment claims. ""Tribunals play a critical role in the administration of justice in Singapore, because of the number and the spectrum of the dispute that they deal with,"" said Chief Justice Menon. ""The authors (of this book) have deliberately avoided the use of technical or complex jargon, to ensure that the text remains highly accessible to laypersons,"" he added. Both books can be bought online from Academy Publishing ( At the event, Chief Justice Menon also witnessed the signing of memorandums of understanding with the law schools of the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU), and Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). The MOUs with NUS and SMU law schools formalise the Clinical Clerkship Programme that was piloted two years ago with NUS and extended to SMU this year, to give law students the opportunity to experience judicial work. Students under the joint NUS-SMU law module are supervised by two senior judges of the State Courts - the Deputy Presiding Judge and the Senior District Judge. The MOU with the SUSS School of Law establishes the Legal Clerkship Programme to provide students with practical training and clinical experience, by allowing them to prepare court documents and present them in a mock court hearing, and to develop their written and oral advocacy skills.

A district court heard on Monday (Nov 4) that the insurance firms or agents would then allegedly receive accreditation from the embassy in return. James Yeo Siew Liang, 48, who represented AIG Asia Pacific Insurance and Liberty Insurance, is accused of agreeing to be part of the plan. A search on the General Insurance Association Of Singapore's website reveals no information about him. He is accused of giving more than $21,000 in bribes to the translator, Abdul Aziz Mohamed Hanib, 64. Yeo is also said to have given more than $71,000 to the labour attache, Agus Ramdhany Machjumi, who is no longer in Singapore. The court heard that Aziz allegedly found Yeo through an intermediary, Benjamin Chow Tuck Keong, 56, who was a corporate development director of a firm dealing with organic products. According to court documents, Chow did not give or receive any money. Aziz, Yeo and Chow are on trial, with Aziz and Yeo facing more than 15 graft-related charges each and Chow, one. On the first day of the trial on Monday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Alan Loh said that since Feb 1 last year, the embassy in Singapore made it compulsory for all local employers hiring Indonesian maids to buy a $6,000 performance bond. This allowed the Indonesian Embassy to call on the bond for the benefit of the maids in the event of any purported breaches of employment conditions by the employer. This was in addition to the $5,000 security bond required by Singapore's Ministry of Manpower. The DPP added: ""This was clearly a lucrative business for general insurers if they received accreditation from the Indonesian Embassy, as they could collect a $70 premium for each (performance bond) issued in respect of an estimated 120,000 (Indonesian foreign domestic workers) in Singapore. ""The insurers could seek reimbursement from the employers in the event that a (performance bond) was called on."" This, in turn, allowed the insurers to pay their agents a ""generous"" 45 per cent of the premiums earned for each bond and was a ""win-win for insurers and their agents"", the court heard. DPP Loh told District Judge Ong Luan Tze that Agus had been in charge of issuing accreditation to insurers for the performance bonds. He said: ""Instead of freely and openly giving accreditation to the 37 licensed general insurance companies in Singapore, Agus tasked Aziz to look for insurance companies (or) insurance agents who would agree to give them a share of the premiums collected in exchange for accreditation."" Between February and June last year, AIG and Liberty sold more than 5,700 performance bonds. Yeo then allegedly gave the bribes without the two firms' knowledge. There is also no evidence that the Indonesian Embassy knew or approved of Agus purportedly receiving such share of commissions. In an earlier statement, the Indonesian Embassy said Agus had left his post, adding: ""We are taking the case seriously because we will not tolerate any misconduct. ""Our authority is also seeking to collaborate on mutual legal assistance in accordance with law and regulations of both countries."" Aziz and Yeo are represented by lawyers Andre Jumabhoy and Chia Boon Teck respectively. Defence lawyer Favian Kang represents Chow. Yeo and Aziz are out on bail of $50,000 each while Chow’s bail was set at $10,000. The trial resumes on Tuesday. The trial resumes on Monday afternoon. For each graft charge, offenders can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000. "

The 46-year-old was already motionless and had no pulse when officers arrived on the scene, the police said. He was later pronounced dead by a paramedic. In its report published yesterday, Shin Min reported the man as saying he was unable to sleep for two nights after the incident because of the psychological stress. He claimed that he was physically smaller than the 46-year-old man, and that he was pushed aside during the struggle and even sprained his ankle. ""We were only carrying out our civic duty, and only wanted to wait for the police to arrive,"" he said. The evening daily reported that another man, who also helped to subdue the 46-year-old, broke down when interviewed by the police. Ms Diana Ngiam, associate director at law firm Quahe Woo & Palmer, said that in such cases, an autopsy is usually done to determine the cause of death. If it still remains unclear, a coroner's inquiry could be held. ""The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) will usually decide after the State Coroner has made his findings as to whether to prosecute any of the five involved-if there is evidence that the actions of any of the five are related to the man's death,"" Ms Ngiam said. The AGC will have to consider the intention of the individuals in deciding whether to prosecute, she said, adding that the full facts will be carefully considered before any decision is made. Mr Amolat Singh of Amolat & Partners said the incident serves as a lesson to be careful to not use excessive force in making a citizen's arrest. It will be difficult to determine the exact role played by each individual, he added. The case has been classified as an unnatural death and police are investigating. "

The three male victims suffered serious injuries including broken bones and deep cuts. One man's ear was almost severed in the brutal pre-dawn slashing. One of the three, who gave his name only as Eugene, told The Straits Times on Saturday that their group of eight had been heading home at around 6am after a Halloween-themed party at nightclub Marquee when they were accosted. While in the basement carpark of the integrated resort, a man dressed in a doctor's coat allegedly charged at him, said Eugene, 25. ""At first I thought it was one of those Halloween jump scare kind of things,"" he said, describing the blade as resembling a short sword. The sword was swung so hard that Eugene suffered broken bones in both legs. One of his companions, who gave his name as Wei, 34, said that he stepped in to defend his friend and was also slashed. He showed ST gashes on his forehead, chin and ear, part of which had been left dangling and had to be stitched back together. Eugene, a manager, said of his friend: ""He was lying in a pool of blood, face turned purple... Thankfully, one of my friends is a nurse, and she managed to stem the bleeding."" Another friend who was filming the incident on his phone was beaten by another attacker and suffered bruises and a sprain, he said. The police confirmed the incident, saying it responded to an incident at 1 Bayfront Avenue at about 6.15am on Oct 27. In the statement, police said three male victims, aged between 25 and 34, were conveyed conscious to Singapore General Hospital. Police subsequently identified and arrested three men, aged between 22 and 24, in connection with the case. They were charged last Wednesday (Oct 30) for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon with common intention, which carries a sentence of up to seven years' imprisonment as well as a possible fine and caning. The trio are in remand and due to appear in court on Nov 6. Eugene, who had screws inserted in his left leg to join the broken bones, was discharged from the hospital on Friday. Doctors say it will be at least a year before he will be able to walk again. Eugene and Wei said that they were disappointed with how MBS handled the matter, both during the incident and in the days after. A security guard arrived at the scene only about 30 minutes after the incident, after being alerted by a friend of the victims who had gone looking for help, Eugene claimed. While the police and ambulance arrived within 10 minutes of being called, there was a slight delay in locating them within the carpark. ""If security knew this was happening under their noses, they would have been able to direct them to us,"" he said. Eugene added that he had contacted MBS on Thursday to ask what was being done about the incident and a customer service officer referred him to the police. Replying to queries, an MBS spokesman said it was alerted to the incident at 6.20am on Oct 27 and responded immediately. ""We take a serious view of this case and are working closely with the police in its ongoing investigations,"" she said. "

Figures released by the police showed a year-on-year increase in the number of foreign women arrested for online vice. Last year, 1,417 women were arrested, almost double that in 2015. The numbers were revealed to the media following a police raid in a Housing Board estate in Woodlands on Oct 25. In the raid, which the media was privy to, six women aged between 25 and 45 were arrested for suspected involvement in vice-related activities. They were found in two HDB flats, just a five-minute drive away from each other. In a statement yesterday, the police said property owners played an important role in preventing such illicit activities. ""HDB flats are meant for residential purposes, and the use of flats for vice activities is strictly prohibited,"" said the police, adding that flat owners and tenants who knowingly allow their premises to be used for vice would be prosecuted under the Women's Charter. During the raid, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police (DAC) Deculan Goh noted that proposed amendments to the charter would make home owners, tenants and property agents more responsible in ensuring that no vice activities were carried out in homes. He also said vice activities in residential estates were a concern as the number of such cases has been rising. No figures were immediately available on the number of arrests in estates, but the police announced last month that 106 women were nabbed for vice during enforcement operations between August and September in condominiums, residential units and hotels. Under proposed changes to the charter, home owners and tenants would need to show that they could not, with reasonable diligence, have known that the place would be used for vice activities. Property agents who knowingly helped rent out property for vice could also be liable to criminal prosecution. Said DAC Goh: ""Moving forward, the liability will be on them to make sure that they do their checks and due diligence."" Currently, flat owners and tenants found guilty of knowingly allowing their premises to be used for vice can be jailed for up to three years and fined $3,000. Recalcitrant offenders could be liable for a jail term of up to five years, and a maximum fine of $10,000. "

After replying, Temasek Polytechnic student Muhammad Adli Adi placed only his left hand on the handlebar and did not notice Madam Poh Cho Hui, 60, walking in front of him. His bicycle struck her before he could stop it and she fell to the ground. The accident took place at around 8pm on June 3 last year. The mother of three was taken to Changi General Hospital (CGH) but Madam Poh died of a head injury six days later. Adli, 19, who is no longer working for Food Panda, was sentenced yesterday to two weeks' jail after pleading guilty to causing Madam Poh's death by a negligent act. Before the accident took place, he had been delivering food for the company and was riding along the Tampines Park Connector near Block 495E Tampines Street 43 at a speed of around 23kmh. The court heard that the speed limit along the shared path was 25kmh and the bicycle was not fitted with a front headlight. After the collision, Madam Poh was seen lying face up on the ground and was bleeding from the back of her head. She was unresponsive even though her eyes were open. The police were alerted and an ambulance took her to CGH, where she was found to have suffered a traumatic brain injury. She died on June 9 last year. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sanjiv Vaswani told District Judge Eddy Tham that Adli had been riding a fixed-gear bicycle, which did not have a manual braking system. Instead, it was fitted with a pedal brake mechanism which was operated by turning the pedals backwards. Urging the judge to sentence the student to three weeks' jail, the DPP added that such bicycles were ""more difficult to control"". ""It is submitted that the accused's use of such a bicycle at high speed"", coupled with his failure to hold onto both sides of the handlebar of his bicycle, ""further affects the extent to which the accused ought to be found negligent"". Defence lawyer Michael Han asked the judge to call for a report to assess his client's suitability for a probation, stressing that Adli was a youthful offender. Before handing down the sentence, Judge Tham noted that probation is a relevant sentencing option for young offenders. But he added that in cases where a death is caused, rehabilitation ""takes a back seat"". The judge said that a message must be sent to deter others from committing a similar offence. "

Yesterday, the 46-year-old woman was sentenced to two months' jail after admitting that she had told the 18-year-old girl to lie to the police. The woman and others involved in the case cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity. Deputy Public Prosecutor Shenna Tjoa said that a police report was made on May 1, 2016 about the sexual offence. Court documents did not disclose details of the offence or the victim's age. The following month, the mother asked to meet the classmate of the victim at the void deck of a block of flats in Ang Mo Kio. She told the teenager to tell the police that on the day of the sexual offence, the girl was with the victim in the woman's flat while her son - who is now 20 - was sleeping in another part of the unit. The teenager later told the police the fabricated story as she was afraid that the woman would hurt her. DPP Tjoa told District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt: ""Police resources were expended and further statements had to be recorded from the witnesses involved in the sexual assault offence because of (the teenager's) statement containing the false story, which was also consistent with the false statement provided by (the mother) to the police.""

Last December, co-owner Ng Cheng Hock returned from Japan after spending 18 years in prison there for drug offences. Madam Tan, 63, said he created disturbances at the flat and sent her death threats, prompting her to apply to court for the property, now worth $450,000, to be sold. Mr Ng, 59, said he had agreed to be a co-owner of the flat to help Madam Tan - his friend's mistress - secure a roof over her head. He argued that his contribution towards the purchase price was 43.4 per cent, which is worth about $170,000. But his sole investment was an initial payment of about $7,900 from his Central Provident Fund account, or 3.3 per cent of the purchase price, and he was later compensated $5,000 in cash. Madam Tan said he should get just 5 per cent of the proceeds, or about $20,000, as per their respective shareholding indicated in documents and the land titles register. In the grounds of decision on Thursday, the High Court granted an order for the flat to be sold, and ruled that Madam Tan was entitled to 95 per cent of the sale proceeds. Justice Pang Khang Chau said: ""Mr Ng is bound by the contractual documents he signed and therefore acquired only a 5 per cent share in the flat."" The pair had bought the Woodlands flat from the Housing Board under the Joint Singles Scheme as tenants-in-common. Mr Ng claimed that Madam Tan was pregnant at the time and that his friend, identified only as Mr Ang, wanted to provide for her. He said Mr Ang sought his help to buy a flat with Madam Tan and agreed to pay him $5,000. Mr Ng said it was his understanding that he and Madam Tan would own the flat ""equally"" and was not aware that documents stated he held only a 5 per cent stake. He argued that, as an HDB loan of $190,100 was taken out in their joint names, he should be regarded as having contributed a further $95,050 towards the purchase. Madam Tan disputed Mr Ng's version of events. She said she was planning to buy a flat with her mother when the latter suddenly died. Madam Tan said Mr Ng agreed to co-own a flat with her after she expressed concern that she and her two daughters would be left without a roof over their heads. Justice Pang said that whether by Mr Ng's version or Madam Tan's, the key feature was that Mr Ng's help was needed because Madam Tan was unable to buy a flat on her own due to HDB requirements. ""Given this factual background, it was extremely unlikely that either Mr Ang or Madam Tan would have expected Mr Ng to bear responsibility for half of the mortgage loan and equally unlikely that Mr Ng would have agreed to do so."" The judge said the fact that Mr Ng moved to Japan after the purchase and made no contribution towards the loan repayment was strong evidence that the parties' understanding was that she would be solely responsible for the loan repayment. However, the judge turned down Madam Tan's request to be given the right to buy over Mr Ng's share at the valuation price. Both Madam Tan and Mr Ng have appealed. "

But prosecutors countered that there was no reason for the family to lie, pointing out that after Mr Liew decided to terminate the maid's employment, his wife had given the Indonesian three months' salary amounting to $1,800. Parti Liyani, who worked for the family from 2007 to 2016, is appealing to the High Court against  During Parti's district court trial, Mr Liew testified that he suspected her of stealing for years when things went missing at his Chancery Lane house, but his wife told him it may not have been the maid who took them. Mr Liew said he finally decided to terminate her employment in October 2016. The last straw was the loss of a portable power bank given to him by a French university that had invited him to give a guest lecture. As he was overseas, he asked his son Karl Liew to oversee the termination of her service and her repatriation to Indonesia. On Oct 28 that year, Mr Karl Liew told Parti that she would no longer be working for the family and gave her about three hours to pack her belongings. He agreed to pay for the three boxes to be shipped to her home and the maid returned to Indonesia. The next day, the family opened the boxes to check the contents and found many of their belongings inside. A police report was made after the CAG chairman returned to Singapore. On Friday, Parti's lawyer Anil Balchandani argued that the discovery of items in the boxes presented a convenient avenue for the family to prevent the maid from returning to Singapore and reporting them to the Manpower Ministry. Mr Anil said that besides working at the family home, Parti was regularly told to clean Mr Karl Liew's office. In October 2016, she was tasked to clean his house. The lawyer asserted that Parti was fired for refusing to comply after doing so for a week. Mr Anil argued that the items alleged to be stolen were either discarded objects, Parti's own belongings, or things that had been put into the boxes by someone else. More than 10 items were presented to High Court judge Chan Seng Onn for inspection. The items Mr Anil said were discarded included a DVD recorder that could not play DVDs and a Gerald Genta watch with a missing knob and broken strap. Mr Anil also showed the court various items of clothing, arguing that they were Parti's but Mr Karl Liew had claimed they were his. These included a shirt with buttons on the left, which the lawyer pointed out was a feature of women's shirts. The appeal hearing was adjourned for the prosecution to continue its arguments. "

The court heard that he suddenly became agitated and raised his right fist, causing one of his friends to rush forward and pull him away. His other friend apologised to the group and told them that Jeffry was drunk. A group of police officers including Staff Sgt Ong later arrived at the scene due to the commotion. Two of the officers were interviewing Jeffry and his friends when the NSF suddenly hurled an expletive at Staff Sgt Ong before challenging the older man to a fight. Jeffry later shoved Staff Sgt Ong's shoulder and grabbed the latter's elbows. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng said: ""A struggle between the accused and complainant ensued, as the complainant tried to break free from the accused, who was holding onto the complainant's elbows. ""In the midst of the struggle, both the accused and complainant lost their balance and fell onto the ground. The complainant landed on his back, with the accused falling on top of the complainant.""

Staff Sgt Ong went to the Singapore General Hospital where he was found with injuries, including multiple marks on his neck and an abrasion on his left shoulder. He was given two days of medical leave. On Friday, District Judge Ong Chin Rhu called for a report to assess Jeffry's suitability for probation.

Two Singaporean men, both 31, were arrested, CNB said in a statement on Friday. One of the men, a suspected drug trafficker, was arrested by CNB officers on Thursday afternoon in Bedok Reservoir Road, shortly after he alighted from his car. They found about 11g of the drug Ice on him. When searching his car, the officers found a total of about 4g of Ice and other drug paraphernalia, including improvised drug-smoking apparatuses. Later, they searched the suspect's residential unit in the same area and found a digital weighing scale. After follow-up investigations, the officers raided a unit in Lorong 15 Geylang after entering by force as the occupant refused to comply with the officers' orders. They found about 55g of ketamine, 444g of Ice, three Yaba tablets, 102 Erimin-5 tablets and 107 Ecstasy tablets in the unit. Some of the Ice recovered from the unit were pink-coloured. The drug activities of the two suspects are being investigated. The amount of Ice found in the operation is enough to feed the addiction of 262 abusers for a week, said CNB. "

This can be raised further to $30,000 if the parties involved agree in writing, said the State Courts in a statement. The increased limit for claims filed at the tribunals is one of the amendments made to the Small Claims Tribunals Act to provide greater access to justice, the State Courts said on Friday. The duration for making a claim will also be extended, from one year to two years. This applies to claims that arise from Nov 1, 2018. The raising of the default limit at the tribunals was part of measures passed in Parliament in July last year. At the time, Senior Minister of State for Law Edwin Tong said the increase in claim limit is in line with countries such as Britain, Australia and Canada, and ""will allow more parties to resolve their claims before the tribunals at less cost"". Mr Tong also said the extended two-year period will give people more time to negotiate and settle their disputes amicably while ensuring they have enough time to file their claim. The Small Claims Tribunals, set up in 1985, hear cases on contracts for the sale of goods or the provision of services, claims in tort for damage caused to property as well as certain tenancy disputes. Besides the raised claim limit, people can also take their hire-purchase claims to the tribunals if the claims are related to an unfair practice. Hire-purchase agreements allow consumers to pay for goods such as household appliances through instalments. Examples of unfair practices include a seller portraying a product to be of a certain quality or model, or presenting the product to be new, when it is not. Another new measure that kicks in from Friday enables a registrar or tribunal to order parties to attend mandatory mediation at the Community Mediation Centre, or before any person. A district court can also remit a matter to the tribunal for reconsideration or order a re-hearing by a different tribunal under certain limited circumstances. In addition, the Small Claims Tribunals may order a tenant who has not paid rent to vacate the property besides paying the outstanding rent. It can also order a party to pay the other party’s costs of the proceedings, including in a situation of an abuse of process such as frivolous claims or deliberate delays to the proceedings. "

He had earlier pleaded guilty to two mischief charges and one count of engaging in a conspiracy to commit mischief by fire. Safie went to the Choa Chu Kang flat in early February and found that the lock had been changed. The court heard that his former wife and son had done so to deter him from harassing them.

His former wife and son had placed the items there as Safie was no longer living in the flat, and had asked him to retrieve them.

The accused, who was 19 at the time of the offence in 2017, admitted that he had sex with the girl without her consent at the foot of a Housing Board block in Pasir Ris, while his co-accused, then 18, held her head. The co-accused is charged with attempted rape and sexual assault by penetration but his case is still pending. The accused's case was adjourned to Dec 2 for sentencing arguments. Seven other charges, including one each for sexual assault by penetration and abetment of attempted rape, will be considered when he is sentenced. The two youths, who worked as waiters at the time, are not named due to a gag order barring the publication of information that can lead to the identification of the victim, a Singapore permanent resident. The High Court heard that the girl befriended a group of four youths in 2017 and hung out with them at various locations in Pasir Ris. Number of charges the 21-year-old youth is facing. He has pleaded guilty to a charge of rape. Seven other charges will be considered when he is sentenced. The accused's case was adjourned to Dec 2 for sentencing arguments. In the early hours of Oct 17, 2017, the girl, the accused and another friend played a game of Truth Or Dare at the void deck of a block in the neighbourhood. She became increasingly intoxicated as she had to drink some beer each time she refused to answer the questions posed by the other two. The trio were later joined by two others, including the co-accused. Two of the youths then bought three condoms with $1 taken from the girl's wallet, after one of them asked the two accused if they wanted to have sex with her. As the group left the block, two of them took turns to piggyback the girl as she was too drunk to walk properly. At about 4am, the two accused waited for the girl when she stopped to relieve herself at the foot of a block, and became separated from the other two youths who had walked ahead. The duo tried to rouse the victim and, when she did not respond, they touched her breasts and sexually violated her. While the accused raped the girl, one of the friends who had walked ahead phoned to find out where they were. The co-accused replied that they were taking care of the girl as she was throwing up. Throughout the episode, the girl drifted in and out of consciousness but was too weak to resist. The pair then called one of the friends for help and, shortly after he arrived, the two left for home. When the girl told the friend that she had been raped, he called the co-accused for an explanation. The girl then slapped the co-accused when he returned to the scene. Later, police officers on patrol approached the group as the girl was crying. She eventually gave a full account at the police station. "

Senior Judge Andrew Ang allowed the Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan's application to convert the current originating summons by The Ngee Ann Kongsi into a writ action, which means the case is heard in an open court involving a wider scope, including witness evidence, if available. The judge found there was a ""substantial dispute of fact likely to arise"", which was the bottom line before the court could consider its discretion to convert the originating summons into a writ action. ""There are other procedural advantages in a writ action which makes this case appropriate for conversion,"" said Senior Judge Ang in decision grounds on Wednesday. The Ngee Ann Kongsi last year applied for a court order by way of originating summons for the Huay Kuan to yield possession of the 183.5 sq m office space it occupies in the building at 97 Tank Road. The Huay Kuan, the apex organisation comprising 5,000 Teochew members, had, in turn, claimed the Tank Road building is held on trust for its benefit and seeks a declaration that it is entitled to continue to occupy the Teochew Building. The Huay Kuan applied to the court to convert the originating summons into a writ action, which The Ngee Ann Kongsi resisted. The court heard the application in chambers over three days earlier this year, with both parties fronted by heavyweight lawyers. Senior Counsel Davinder Singh and lawyer Jaikanth Shankar from Davinder Singh Chambers as instructed counsel led a team of lawyers for The Ngee Ann Kongsi, while WongPartnership lawyers led by Senior Counsel Tan Chee Meng and lawyer Josephine Choo defended the Huay Kuan. Senior Judge Ang, who noted that the Huay Kuan had occupied the building since 1963, held it likely that a substantial dispute of fact will arise in relation to legal claims involved in the rights to use the property. The judge added that while discovery of documents - seeking relevant evidence from documents - is also available in an originating summons, the discovery obligations on both parties are wider in a writ action, which would enable ""a fairer resolution of the dispute"". Senior Judge Ang said The Ngee Ann Kongsi's fears that conversion may ""needlessly protract"" the proceedings could be addressed by applying for summary judgment or by striking out pleadings and endorsements under prescribed court rules. The events behind the dispute span more than 100 years involving the history of two of Singapore's most prominent Teochew organisations, noted Senior Judge Ang. ""It is sad to see the two organisations unable to resolve matters amicably, despite what I find to be a clear history of fraternal relations between them,"" he said. A spokesman for The Ngee Ann Kongsi said it would review the court's decision together with its lawyers. ""We gave notice since June 28, 2017, for Huay Kuan to vacate the building and regret the matter continues to be dragged through legal proceedings."" The Huay Kuan said yesterday it was happy the court has given each party a chance to tell its side of the story and hopes the matter may be resolved amicably. ""We are glad the contents of some important historical records which we provided have been considered by the court in reaching its decision."" "

Second Principal District Judge Victor Yeo yesterday found Mohamed Farid Mohd Saleh, 36, guilty of instigating Muhammad Nur Fatwa Mahmood, 34, a staff sergeant, to commit a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide by telling him to push Corporal Kok into a 12m-deep pump well at the Tuas View Fire Station on May 13 last year. Cpl Kok drowned after Nur Fatwa pushed him in. Two men involved in the case pleaded guilty earlier to their offences. Nur Fatwa was sentenced to one year and four weeks in jail last October while Adighazali Suhaimi, 33, a staff sergeant, was jailed for a month in December last year. Two others - Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer - have claimed trial and their cases are still pending. On the day of the incident, most of the officers on duty at the fire station had gathered in the control room for a cake-cutting ceremony to celebrate Cpl Kok's impending completion of national service. Some officers then lifted Cpl Kok and carried him to the pump well across the yard. Nur Fatwa had earlier testified during the trial that Farid told him to push Cpl Kok into the pump well. Yesterday, Judge Yeo said: ""I do find Fatwa to be a credible witness (and his) testimony contained a ring of truth."" The judge noted that when station commander Huang Weikang found out about the incident, Nur Fatwa ""readily admitted"" that he had pushed Cpl Kok and that Farid had told him to do so. Judge Yeo also noted that Farid, who was nearby at the time, did not say anything in response. The judge highlighted that Farid and Nur Fatwa had been good friends, and added: ""There is no reason for Fatwa to falsely implicate Farid."" The defence had earlier stated that no one else heard Farid telling Nur Fatwa to push Cpl Kok. Judge Yeo said this did not mean that Nur Fatwa was not telling the truth . He added that with the ""rowdiness"" taking place at the time, it was ""not unexpected"" that no one else heard Farid talking to Nur Fatwa in a voice that was ""between whispering and a normal talking tone"". Farid, who is represented by lawyer Vinit Chhabra, is now out on bail of $15,000. His mitigation and sentencing will take place on Nov 20. For abetting a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide, he can be jailed for up to five years and fined. "

Former private-hire car driver Muhammad Fuad Kamroden, 35, was yesterday sentenced to two years, three months and six weeks' jail. He was also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for a year. The Singaporean pleaded guilty in July to one count each of causing grievous hurt to a lorry driver and causing hurt to an elderly cabby. He also admitted to using criminal force on two other men. The court heard that Mr Pek Lian Hui, 52, was driving his lorry at a National University of Singapore carpark on Aug 12, 2016, when Fuad felt that the older man's vehicle was moving too slowly. He overtook Mr Pek's vehicle and flashed him an obscene hand gesture as he passed before stopping in front of the lorry. Fuad later assaulted the older man, causing injuries that included multiple facial fractures. Fuad was arrested soon after and was out on bail when he got involved in a second road rage incident on Dec 2, 2017. He pushed taxi driver Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed Sharif, 46, causing the man to lose his balance.

In December 2018, co-owner Ng Cheng Hock returned from Japan after spending 18 years in prison there for drug offences. Madam Tan, 63, said he created disturbances at the flat and sent her death threats, prompting her to apply to court for the property, now worth $450,000, to be sold. Mr Ng, 59, said that he had agreed to be a co-owner of the flat in order to help Madam Tan - his friend's mistress - secure a roof over her head. His only monetary contribution was an initial payment about $7,900 from his CPF account, which was 3.3 per cent of the purchase price. He was later compensated $5,000 in cash. But he argued that his contribution towards the purchase price was 43.4 per cent, which is worth about $170,000. Madam Tan said he should get only 5 per cent of the proceeds - about $20,000- based on their respective shareholding indicated in documents and the land titles register. In grounds of decision on Thursday (Oct 31), the High Court granted an order for the flat to be sold, and ruled that Madam Tan was entitled to 95 per cent of the sale proceeds while Mr Ng was entitled only to 5 per cent. Justice Pang Khang Chau said: ""Mr Ng is bound by the contractual documents he signed and therefore acquired only a 5 per cent share in the flat."" The pair had bought the Woodlands flat from the Housing Board under the Joint Singles Scheme as tenants-in-common, with Madam Tan holding a 95 per cent share and Mr Ng holding a 5 per cent share. Mr Ng claimed that Madam Tan was pregnant at the time and that his friend, identified only as ""Mr Ang"", wanted to provide for her. He said Mr Ang sought his help to buy a flat with Madam Tan and agreed to pay him $5,000. Mr Ng said it was his understanding that he and Madam Tan would own the flat ""equally"" and was not aware that documents stated he held only a 5 per cent stake. He argued that, as a HDB loan of $190,100 was taken out in their joint names, he should be regarded as having contributed a further $95,050 towards the purchase. Madam Tan disputed Mr Ng's version of events. She said she was planning to buy a flat with her mother when the latter suddenly died. Madam Tan said Mr Ng agreed to co-own a flat with her after she expressed concern that she and her two daughters would be left without a roof over their heads. Justice Pang said that whether on Mr Ng's version or Madam Tan's version, the key feature was that Mr Ng's help was necessary because Madam Tan was unable to buy a flat on her own due to HDB requirements. ""Given this factual background, it was extremely unlikely that either Mr Ang or Madam Tan would have expected Mr Ng to bear responsibility for half of the mortgage loan and equally unlikely that Mr Ng would have agreed to do so."" The judge said the fact that Mr Ng moved to Japan after the purchase and made no contribution towards the loan repayment was strong evidence that the parties' understanding was that Madam Tan would be solely responsible for the loan repayment. However, the judge turned down Madam Tan's request to be given the right to buy over Mr Ng's share at the valuation price. Both Madam Tan and Mr Ng have filed appeals. "

The accused, who was 19 at the time of the offence in 2017, admitted that he had sex with the girl without her consent at the foot of a Housing Board block in Pasir Ris, while his co-accused, then 18, held her head. The latter is charged with attempted rape and sexual assault by penetration but his case is still pending. The accused's case was adjourned to Dec 2 for sentencing arguments. Seven other charges, including one each for sexual assault by penetration and one for abetment of attempted rape, will be considered when he is sentenced. The two youths, who worked as waiters at the time, are not named due to a gag order barring the publication of information that can lead to the identification of the victim, who is a Singapore permanent resident. The High Court heard that the girl befriended a group of four youths in 2017 and hung out with them at various locations in Pasir Ris. In the early hours of Oct 17, 2017, the girl, the accused and another friend played a game of Truth or Dare at the void deck of a block in the neighbourhood. She became increasingly intoxicated as she had to drink some beer each time she refused to answer the questions posed by the other two. The trio was later joined by two others, including the co-accused. Two of the youths then bought three condoms with $1 taken from the girl's wallet, after one of them asked the two accused if they wanted to have sex with her. As the group left the block, the accused and another youth took turns to piggyback the girl as she was too drunk to walk properly. At about 4am, the two accused youths waited for the girl when she stopped to relieve herself at the foot of a block, and became separated from the other two youths who had walked ahead. The pair tried to rouse the victim, and when she did not respond, they touched her breasts and sexually violated her. While the accused raped the girl, one of the friends who had walked ahead phoned to find out where they were. The co-accused replied in a text message that they were taking care of her as she was throwing up. Throughout the entire episode, the girl drifted in and out of consciousness but was too weak to resist. The pair then called one of the friends for help and shortly after he arrived, the two left for home. When the girl told the friend that she had been raped, he called the co-accused and sought an explanation. When the co-accused returned to the scene, the girl slapped him. Later, police officers on patrol approached the group as the girl was crying. She did not immediately disclose what had happened but later gave a full account at the police station. "

Senior Judge Andrew Ang allowed the Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan's application to convert the current originating summons by the Ngee Ann Kongsi to a writ action, which means the case is heard in an open court.

Nur Fatwa was  Two others - Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, a 38-year-old lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer -  Earlier on the day of the incident, most of the officers on duty at the fire station had gathered in the control room for a cake-cutting ceremony to celebrate Cpl Kok's impending completion of national service. Some officers then lifted Cpl Kok and carried him to the pump well across the yard. Nur Fatwa had earlier testified during the trial that Farid told him to push Cpl Kok into the pump well. On Thursday, Judge Yeo said: ""I do find Fatwa to be a credible witness (and his) testimony contained a ring of truth."" The judge noted that when station commander Huang Weikang found out about the incident, Nur Fatwa ""readily admitted"" that he had pushed Cpl Kok and that Farid had told him to do so. Judge Yeo also noted that Farid, who was nearby at the time, did not say anything in response. The judge highlighted that Farid and Nur Fatwa had been good friends, and added: ""There is no reason for Fatwa to falsely implicate Farid."" The court heard that Farid's defence was one of ""pure denial"" - that he did not tell Nur Fatwa to push their subordinate. The defence had also earlier stated that no one else had heard Farid telling Nur Fatwa to push Cpl Kok. On Thursday, Judge Yeo said this did not mean that Nur Fatwa was not telling the truth . He added that with the ""rowdiness"" that was taking place in the area at the time, it was ""not unexpected"" that no one else heard Farid talking to Nur Fatwa in a voice that was ""between whispering and a normal talking tone"". The judge said: ""The defence sought to establish that Fatwa did not want to face the charge alone, or to shoulder the responsibility of what had happened. ""Whilst there may be some merit to this argument, upon careful consideration and further reflection I did not think that Fatwa would go to the extent to fabricate the allegation against his good friend and colleague."" Farid, who is represented by lawyer Vinit Chhabra, is now out on bail of $15,000. His mitigation and sentencing will take place on Nov 20. For abetting a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide, he can be jailed for up to five years and fined. "

District Judge Luke Tan convicted him earlier this month of eight money-laundering charges and 22 counts of forgery. In their submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Kevin Yong and Stacey Fernandez said: ""This is possibly the first time where the Singapore authorities have managed to arrest and prosecute a foreign individual who was mostly based overseas, and who worked behind the scenes with others to exploit Singapore's financial system to perpetrate money-laundering offences."" The Russian, Zkert M. Rushdi, 57, was sentenced on Wednesday (Oct 30) to seven years and four months' jail. Rushdi committed his offences from May to October 2016 and they involved more than US$327,000 in total. The cases were linked to four victims from Indonesia, Australia and Bermuda who were cheated of the amount. Thirteen other charges for similar offences involving the remaining amount were considered during sentencing. The DPPs said that Rushdi worked with a ""shadowy individual"" known only as ""Iho"" or ""Ihab Khalil"", helping him and his customers open corporate bank accounts in the name of shell companies. Rushdi also worked with local corporate service providers to incorporate shell companies in Singapore by using the names of Europeans he recruited to be the foreign directors of these firms. According to court documents, a man identified as Darrel Tan Hock Keat helped Rushdi in incorporating three companies - Glidertex, Plutusteam and Birseltex - and open bank accounts in Singapore under the firms' names. A fourth company called Botitex was incorporated in Hong Kong in March 2016 and Rushdi also arranged for a bank account to be opened in its name here. The court heard that Rushdi's sole purpose of setting up these shell companies was to open bank accounts here. He would then accompany the foreign directors to Singapore to attend interviews with bank officers as part of the account-opening process. These foreigners were just directors in name and the companies conducted no real businesses, the court heard. The DPPs added: ""He would provide the foreign directors with forged documents to fraudulently use as genuine during the interviews. Once the bank accounts were successfully set up, the accused would hand control of the accounts to Iho."" As a result of this arrangement, four bank accounts from DBS and UOB that Iho controlled received benefits of criminal conduct totalling more than US$327,000. Rushdi, who was unrepresented, had earlier admitted that he was paid between US$1,500 and US$5,000 for every company he incorporated. He had also claimed that the bank accounts were set up to allow ""Iho's customers in Europe in enjoy tax-free concessions in Singapore for one year"". It was not mentioned on Wednesday how the offences came to light but Rushdi was finally arrested in Singapore on Oct 26, 2016. The authorities managed to recover more than US$66,000 which could be traced to the victims. For each count of money laundering, offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000.

Those found guilty could be jailed for up to two years, fined between $2,000 and $10,000, or both. ""The police have zero tolerance against acts that endanger the lives or safety of others as well as cause undue alarm to the public, and will not hesitate to take action against those who blatantly disregard the law,"" the police added.

Unable to tolerate the abuse, she fled from the Malaysian deliveryman's flat on May 29, 2017, and alerted the Ministry of Manpower the next day. Yau Terng Phun, 56,was sentenced on Tuesday (Oct 29) to 15 months and six weeks' jail. The Singapore permanent resident had earlier pleaded guilty to two molestation charges and one count of insulting the maid's modesty. She cannot be named due to a gag order. The 41-year-old woman had started working at Yau's flat in January 2017. About two months later, while she was in the toilet, he snapped her photos after placing his mobile phone over the toilet door. Deputy Public Prosecutor R. Arvindren said: ""The victim saw the accused's hand at the top of the toilet door and was shocked to see him using his handphone to take pictures of her. ""The victim immediately covered herself and scolded the accused for insulting her modesty. The accused was unremorseful and said he was just kidding."" The DPP added that Yau, a married man, then deleted the images a few days later. The court heard that Yau and his wife were not on good terms and did not share a room. Instead, the wife slept in the same room as the maid. Yau abused the maid again in mid-April 2017. The helper had decided to sleep in the living room as Yau's wife was on the phone in the room they shared. The Indonesian was jolted awake when she felt Yau touching her private parts. But even then he did not stop, slipping his hand underneath her top to molest her again. The DPP told District Judge Ong Luan Tze: ""The victim immediately scolded the accused and told him that he had outraged her modesty. Instead of being remorseful, the accused replied that he can give the victim anything she wants. ""In reply, the victim said that she only wished to do the work of a domestic maid and will not do anything sexual."" Yau then returned to his own room. The maid finally ran away on May 29 that year. DPP Arvindren had urged Judge Ong to sentence Yau to at least 17 months' jail, adding that the Malaysian had made his ""supposedly safe home a living hell"" for the maid. Defence lawyer A. P. Thirumurthy pleaded for his client to be given 13 months' and two weeks' jail and stressed that Yau had no earlier convictions. For each count of molestation, offenders can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. Yau cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old. "

Two of them, Muhammad Arif Azman, 22, and Mohamad Haikal Mohammad Zainal Abiddin, 20 - who were doing their national service with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and were at the scene - allegedly took photos of the incident and disseminated them via WhatsApp. Three others received the photos and, despite knowing that the photos were sensitive official information, are accused of having shared them further without authorisation. They are Brandon Tan Jien Jet, 21, Thng Yu Xuan, 21, and Muhammad Zaki Haji Mokhtar, 23. They were also SCDF full-time national servicemen (NSFs). SCDF said in a statement yesterday that internal investigations were conducted to identify those responsible for leaking photos of the accident. ""We filed a police report on Nov 4, 2018, against five full-time national servicemen who were involved. The NSFs were immediately redeployed to non-frontline duties while police investigations were ongoing. All five NSFs have since completed their full-time national service."" SCDF said it expects its officers to uphold exemplary standards of conduct, integrity and discipline at all times. ""We have strict rules to safeguard official information, and view any breach seriously. Any officer who commits offences will be dealt with in accordance with the law.""

Regular serviceman Ong Lin Jie, 28, a captain, was charged with doing a rash act causing death. Court documents said he had allegedly failed to keep a safety distance of 30m between the Land Rover and a Bionix Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which had reversed and mounted the driver's side of the Land Rover during a training exercise at the Murai Urban Training Facility on Nov 3. Corporal First Class (CFC) Liu, 22, a transport operator from SAF's Transport Hub West, died after the Land Rover he was driving was mounted by the Bionix despite repeated commands by the rear guide to stop the Bionix. If convicted, Ong could be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both. Preliminary findings on CFC Liu's death shared by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in Parliament in February showed that the Bionix did not stop reversing despite repeated commands for its driver to do so. It stopped only after mounting the driver's side of the Land Rover. Dr Ng said an independent Committee of Inquiry (COI) formed to look into the circumstances of the incident, as well as the police, were looking into whether the communications equipment used by the Bionix crew was working properly at the time. CFC Liu was then driving Ong from the Active Unit Training Centre, as the latter was assigned to evaluate the exercise troops. The 42nd Battalion Singapore Armoured Regiment (42 SAR) was conducting a two-sided company mission exercise there. During the exercise, the Bionix stopped after it spotted several vehicles involved in the exercise passing a junction ahead of it, according to the preliminary findings of the COI. The Land Rover, which was following the Bionix to assess the crew's performance in the exercise, stopped some distance behind it. Ong then allegedly instructed CFC Liu to overtake the Bionix, and as the latter moved forward slowly, he heard shots fired as part of the exercise. CFC Liu then stopped the Land Rover at a maximum distance of 19.8m from the Bionix. This was short of the 30m safe distance stated in the training safety regulations, Dr Ng said then, adding that the COI noted that it was the responsibility of the Land Rover's vehicle commander to ensure the safety distance. The case had cast the spotlight on deaths in the SAF. It was the third of four training-related deaths in the SAF since September 2017. The Ministry of Defence said yesterday that Ong has been suspended from service, pending the outcome of the court proceedings. It is also conducting its own internal investigation to determine if there have been breaches of military law by other individuals. "

The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said yesterday that officers arrested the 25-year-old Singaporean woman at her unit in Choa Chu Kang Loop on Wednesday afternoon. She surrendered a packet containing 7g of vegetable matter believed to contain cannabis, along with the packet of chocolate and two strawberry taffies believed to be infused with cannabis.

CNB reminded the public that cannabis is a Class A controlled drug listed under Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act and that it is an offence to bring into Singapore any product containing cannabis regardless of the amount in it.

In a written judgment yesterday, Justice Chua Lee Ming dismissed Wham's appeal against the conviction and sentence for organising a public assembly without a permit. Wham, 39, had invited his 7,600 followers on Facebook to attend the public event, called ""Civil Disobedience and Social Movements"", held at an indoor venue on Nov 26, 2016. Days before the event, Wham was advised by the police to apply for a permit, but he did not do so. After the event, he was charged with organising a public assembly without a permit and with refusing to sign a police statement. He was found guilty and sentenced to a $3,200 fine by a district court earlier this year. At his appeal earlier this month, Wham's lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam argued that the event was merely a ""discussion"" and did not fall within the legal definition of an ""assembly"" as it was not carried out to publicise a cause. But Justice Chua concluded that Wham had intended for the event to publicise a cause, specifically to advocate the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. The judge rejected the contention that the event was just a neutral academic discussion. He said it was clear from the description on Facebook that the talks by Mr Wong and two others were about the role of civil disobedience in bringing about change. The judge added that he had no doubt that in inviting Mr Wong, who spoke via a video call, Wham had intended or expected that the Hong Kong activist would advocate the use of civil disobedience. ""Telling the audience how civil disobedience had been used in Hong Kong and asking the audience to think about using civil disobedience in Singapore (were) tantamount to advocating the use of civil disobedience,"" he said. Justice Chua added that statements made by Wham also showed that he was advocating the use of civil disobedience. Wham had told participants that the Singapore approach to activism was to ""have a picnic"" like the Pink Dot movement. Wham then said: ""We don't seem to like this very confrontational civil disobedience types of actions. So how do we get there? I think this is the billion-dollar question."" The judge questioned why Wham would pose the ""billion-dollar question"" if he was not advocating that Singapore citizens move from picnic-type activism to confrontational action. Justice Chua also rejected arguments that the requirement of a permit contravened the constitutional right of Singapore citizens to assemble. As for the second charge, the judge rejected Wham's argument that he did not have a legal obligation to sign his police statement. The requirement for an individual to sign on his statement is to ensure that it was accurate and reliable, he said. The judge added that if a person disagrees with the contents of his statement, he can make amendments before signing it. Wham, who is currently on bail, intends to take the case further to the Court of Appeal to determine questions of law of public interest, said his lawyer. "

You shouldn't be there."" Ms Mata, however, had told the court on Thursday that Huber had seen her on the awning twice but did not stop her. The Filipina, who worked at Huber's Goldhill Avenue house near Dunearn Road from April 2017 to March last year, also testified earlier that Huber's mother had told her to clean the glass awning when it rained ""to save water"". Huber's mother, Madam Tran Kim Anh, took the stand yesterday and, through a Vietnamese interpreter, told District Judge Salina Ishak that she, too, had not seen Ms Mata on the awning. Huber is a director of Huber's, the parent company of Huber's Butchery.

Ed Chen Junyuan appeared in court yesterday to answer a charge of piloting the drone within 5km of the airbase. Chen and a friend, Tay Miow Seng, 40, were separately charged in July this year under the Air Navigation Order. The duo were the first to be charged with unlawfully flying a drone in Singapore. The court heard that Chen had asked Tay to teach him how to operate the drone on June 26. They met around 9pm that same day at an open field just opposite Chen's home. Both men then flew their drones until the batteries went flat. Meanwhile, an off-duty officer with the Republic of Singapore Air Force, who worked at Paya Lebar Air Base, arrived at the field after receiving an alert broadcast to airbase staff about a drone in the area. The officer caught Chen and Tay at the field after spotting blinking lights at their location. Deputy Public Prosecutor Dwayne Lum urged the court during the sentencing hearing for Chen to not be let off with ""a slap on the wrist"", as he was piloting the drone without the required permit and with prior knowledge that an airbase was nearby. DPP Lum said that the sentence should be in the public interest, taking into consideration the importance of deterrence. ""Unregulated operation of drones, especially within close proximity to airbases, poses serious consequences for aircraft safety,"" DPP Lum said. ""In addition, unregulated drone operation also poses a safety risk especially if done in an irresponsible fashion, endangering not just aircraft but persons and property,"" the DPP added. Defence lawyer Josephus Tan, however, pleaded for the court to impose a fine of between $500 and $1,000. The prosecution has asked for a $3,000 fine. Mr Tan argued that Chen was operating a drone without electronic ""geo-fencing"" technology, which allows for clear demarcation of no-fly zones. The lawyer said that without this technology, Chen would not have been likely to know how close exactly he was to the airbase. Mr Tan also argued that Chen flew the drone at the height of only 6m, about two storeys of an HDB block, and this could not have posed any danger to the air traffic control or military aircraft. ""There was no actual harm whatsoever and minimal potential harm. (Chen's) case is therefore wholly unlike the two drone incursions at Changi Airport in June 2019, whereby runway operations and flights were indeed delayed,"" he said. Chen faces a fine of up to $20,000. The hearing has been adjourned to Nov 4. "

The document also falsely stated the child's birthday as March 9, 2014, when he was, in fact, born on July 16 that year. The court heard the boy had a hernia in his groin which was a life-threatening condition that needed an immediate operation. Unaware that the document was false, the consular officer granted the child a Singapore document of identity in lieu of a passport. He was registered as a Singapore citizen on Sept 5, 2014, and came to Singapore two days later. The man, identified in court documents only as ""A"", also tried to apply for a Singapore citizenship for the baby's twin brother by using another false birth certificate, the court heard.

As a result, he made arrangements for his former maid, an Indian national, to take custody of the boys. A would then make arrangements to adopt the children from her.

Wham, 39, had invited his 7,600 followers on Facebook to attend the public event, called “Civil Disobedience and Social Movements”, held at an indoor venue on Nov 26, 2016. Days before the event, on Nov 23, Wham was advised by the police to apply for a permit but he did not do so.  After the event, he was charged with organising a public assembly without a permit and with refusing to sign a police statement. He was found guilty of both charges and sentenced to a $3,200 fine by a district court earlier this year. At his appeal earlier this month, Wham’s lawyer, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, argued that the event was merely a “discussion” and did not fall within the legal definition of an “assembly” as it was not carried out to publicise a cause. But Justice Chua concluded that the prosecution has proven that Wham had intended the event to publicise a cause, specifically to advocate the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. The judge rejected the contention that the event was just a neutral academic discussion. It was clear from the description on Facebook that the talks by Mr Wong and two others were about the role that civil disobedience had to play in bringing about change, he said. The judge added that he had no doubt that in inviting Mr Wong, who spoke via a video call, Wham had intended or expected that the Hong Kong activist would advocate the use of civil disobedience. “Telling the audience how civil disobedience had been used in Hong Kong and asking the audience to think about using civil disobedience in Singapore, was tantamount to advocating the use of civil disobedience,” he said. Justice Chua added that statements made by Wham also showed that he was advocating the use of civil disobedience. Wham had told participants that the Singapore approach to activism was to “have a picnic” like the Pink Dot movement. Wham then said: “We don’t seem to like this very confrontational civil disobedience types of actions. So how do we get there? I think this is the billion-dollar question.” The judge questioned why Wham would pose the “billion-dollar question” if he was not advocating that Singapore citizens should move from picnic-type activism to confrontational actions. Justice Chua also rejected arguments that the requirement of a permit contravened the constitutional right of Singapore citizens to assemble. As for the second charge, the judge rejected Wham’s argument that he did not have a legal obligation to sign his police statement. The requirement for an individual to sign on his statement is to ensure that it was accurate and reliable, he said. The judge added that if a person disagrees with the contents of his statement, he can always make amendments before signing it.   Wham, who is currently on bail, intends to bring the case further to the Court of Appeal to determine questions of law of public interest, said his lawyer.  "

Realising something was amiss, Ms Chiang decided to alert the woman about the upskirt-photo suspect and helped with his eventual arrest. For her efforts on Sept 30, the 42-year-old finance manager was given a Public Spiritedness Award by the police yesterday. Eleven other people were also given the award at the Public Transport Security Command (TransCom) for helping the police with incidents on board public transport or at public transport nodes. For Ms Chiang, she did not want the upskirt-photo suspect to get away with his crime and commit similar offences. ""I felt that I needed to be responsible for making sure that the guy was caught,"" she told The Straits Times. Recounting the incident, Ms Chiang said that after she saw what the suspect did, he hurried up the escalator. When Ms Chiang neared the top of the escalator, she alerted his victim that the man had tried to snap an upskirt photo of her. The two then decided to tail the suspect, with Ms Chiang informing MRT staff at one point about the incident.

After fleeing the Orchard Road hotel, Isa Ahmad followed a second tourist into a lift at the nearby Tang Plaza later the same day and robbed her of her mobile phone. The 54-year-old Singaporean pleaded guilty yesterday to one count each of robbery and attempted aggravated rape. The court heard that Isa had earlier been convicted of multiple counts of robbery. He was last sentenced in October 2002 to 14 years of preventive detention (PD) with the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. PD is only for repeat offenders who are above 30 years old. It involves incarceration, lasting up to 20 years. He was released in 2016 and targeted the women on March 12, 2017. Isa, who worked as a housekeeper at Orchard Hotel Singapore, found the first victim, a 27-year-old, attractive and followed her into the Hilton. They entered the same lift and, by using her key card, the woman gained access to the 16th storey where her room was located. Just as she entered her room at around 11.30am, Isa grabbed her from behind and covered her mouth with his towel. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gregory Gan said the woman managed to kick Isa, and, when she was able to speak, told him someone was returning to the room although she was staying there alone. Alarmed, Isa got out of the room when he heard this and the woman alerted the hotel's security. The police were alerted at 12.50pm. The woman went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was found to have injuries that included a bruised right elbow. Later that day at around 5.30pm, Isa followed a 48-year-old woman into a lift at Tang Plaza before using a second towel to try to restrain her by covering her neck and mouth. She struggled and he managed to take her mobile phone worth about $700. The woman dashed out when the lift doors opened and called the police soon after. Officers managed to trace Isa's identity and arrested him outside Orchard Hotel the next day. Yesterday, District Judge Victor Yeo called for a report on the suitability of a second PD for Isa, who is now in remand and expected to be sentenced on Nov 12. In a statement, the Hilton said: ""The safety, security and well-being of our guests are of paramount importance and we continue to make every effort to ensure all practices and standards are in line with strict safety and security regulations.""

Mr Dhanwant Singh, who acted for the sellers of a $5.8 million Serangoon Road property, contravened professional rules by depositing $100,000 paid by an interested buyer into his firm's clients' account rather than its conveyancing one. Conveyancing accounts are subject to strict controls on withdrawals. Mr Singh then released the $100,000 to the sellers, a family of three who were facing bankruptcy proceedings. The property deal, which took place in 2017, fell through and the sum was not returned to the buyer, who complained to the Law Society and, separately, filed claims against the sellers to recover the money. Mr Singh contested the charges brought by the Law Society, arguing the $100,000 did not fall within the legal definition of ""conveyancing money"" as it was paid by the buyer to extend the option to purchase. This was rejected by a disciplinary tribunal in January which said it was clear the money was paid towards the purchase price. Yesterday, Mr Singh's lawyer, Mr S. Magintharan, repeated the argument before the Court of Three Judges, the highest disciplinary body for errant lawyers. The Law Society brought the case to the court, arguing his conduct was serious enough for sanctions. The society's lawyer Adam Maniam said Mr Singh had shown no remorse. He also noted Mr Singh had antecedents and several ongoing complaints. Mr Singh, who started practising in 1986, was disbarred in 1995 for helping three clients obtain false medical certificates to excuse them from attending court. He was reinstated in 2013. The court, comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Steven Chong, agreed the $100,000 was conveyancing money and said sanctions were warranted as Mr Singh caused potential loss to the buyer.

The housewife in her 50s was told she would get into trouble if she did not help the organisation, and an ""Interpol officer"" accompanied her to a DBS Bank branch to make the withdrawal on Oct 7. But a sharp-eyed bank teller felt that something was amiss, as the ""officer"" answered all of her questions on the woman's behalf - even though it was the woman's bank account. Ms Sally Tay, 50, realised the woman was an unwitting money mule after probing further, and immediately called the police for assistance. Yesterday, Ms Tay was one of nine who received the public spiritedness award at Bedok Police Division. For Ms Tay, another warning sign was when she checked the woman's records and discovered that the money had been transferred into the account on the day itself. The woman's savings had also been transferred out a few days before. Ms Tay alerted her supervisor, who told her to speak to the woman separately while an auxiliary officer kept watch on the man. The woman told her that an ""Interpol officer"" said she was in trouble for a crime overseas and ""Interpol"" needed her cooperation. She even gave them her PIN number, said Ms Tay, adding that the victim believed ""Interpol"" was holding her savings that was earlier withdrawn. ""She kept begging to let her withdraw the money, but I told her that if she couldn't give me a logical explanation for where the funds came from, I couldn't authorise it,"" said Ms Tay. She convinced the woman to tell the police, who took the man away for investigation. ""I felt quite sad for the victim, but happy that I managed to stop the transaction,"" Ms Tay added.

She finally ran away from the club through the back door later that month. During the trial, Priyanka testified that she had ""no involvement at all in the work of the clubs"". She also denied any knowledge or involvement in procuring or arranging for any of the performing artists to go out with customers for sex. Malkar had also testified that his wife had ""no involvement"" in the clubs. The couple, who are represented by lawyer Jayakumar Naidu, are now on bail of $20,000 each. For each charge, first-time offenders convicted of the crime under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $100,000 and receive up to six strokes of the cane.

Mr Dhanwant Singh, who acted for the sellers of a $5.8 million Serangoon Road property, had deposited $100,000 paid by an interested buyer into his firm's clients' account rather than its conveyancing account. This was a contravention of professional rules stipulating that conveyancing money should be deposited into conveyancing accounts, which are subject to strict controls on authorisation for withdrawals. Mr Singh then released the $100,000 to the sellers, a family of three who were facing bankruptcy proceedings. The property deal, which took place in 2017, ultimately fell through and the sum was not returned to the buyer. The buyer complained to the Law Society against Mr Singh and separately, filed claims against the sellers to recover the money. Mr Singh contested the charges brought by the Law Society for contravening the rules. He argued that the $100,000 did not fall within the legal definition of ""conveyancing money"" as it was paid by the buyer to extend the option to purchase. This was rejected by a disciplinary tribunal in January , which said it was clear the money was paid towards the purchase price and hence, defined as conveyancing money. On Wednesday, Mr Singh's lawyer, Mr S. Magintharan, repeated the argument before the Court of Three Judges, the highest disciplinary body for errant lawyers. The Law Society had brought the case to the court, arguing that Mr Singh's conduct was serious enough to warrant imposing sanctions. The society's lawyer, Mr Adam Maniam, said Mr Singh has shown no remorse by continuing to argue that his actions were justified. Mr Maniam also noted that Mr Singh has antecedents and several ongoing complaints. Mr Singh, who started practising in 1986, was disbarred in 1995 for helping three clients obtain false medical certificates to excuse them from attending court. He was reinstated in 2013. The court, comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Steven Chong, agreed that the $100,000 was conveyancing money and said sanctions were warranted as Mr Singh caused potential loss to the buyer.

The housewife in her 50s was told she would get in trouble if she did not help the organisation, and an ""Interpol officer"" accompanied her to a DBS Bank branch to make the withdrawal on Oct 7. But a sharp-eyed bank teller felt something was amiss, as the ""officer"" answered all of her questions on the woman's behalf - even though it was the woman's bank account. DBS staff Sally Tay, 50, realised the woman was an unwitting money mule after probing further, and immediately called the police for assistance. On Wednesday (Oct 23), Ms Tay was one of nine who received the public spiritedness award at Bedok Police Division. For Ms Tay, another warning sign was when the man asked for the $64,000 to be withdrawn in small denominations, instead of being issued as a cheque. Ms Tay checked the woman's records and discovered that the money had been transferred into the account on the day itself. The woman's savings had also been transferred out a few days before. Ms Tay alerted her supervisor, who told her to speak to the woman separately while an auxiliary officer kept watch on the man. ""Initially, she was very reluctant to reveal any information, but later on she managed to open up,"" said Ms Tay. The woman told her that an ""Interpol officer"" said she was in trouble for a crime overseas and they needed her cooperation. She even gave them her PIN number, said Ms Tay, adding that the victim believed the ""Interpol"" was holding her savings that was earlier withdrawn. ""She kept begging to let her withdraw the money, but I told her if she cannot give me a logical explanation for where the funds come from, I cannot authorise it,"" said Ms Tay. She convinced the woman to tell the police, who took the man away for investigation. The account was frozen to prevent any other unauthorised transactions. ""I felt quite sad for the victim, but happy that I managed to stop the transaction,"" she added. At the OCBC bank branch in Parkway Parade, customer service manager Kristie Chiang, 42, has come across several scams in her 12 years with the bank. So when her colleague Alson Ong, 31, told her he suspected a 78-year-old customer had fallen for a love scam, Ms Chiang immediately informed the bank's fraud detection department. The authorities intercepted the woman's transaction of $40,000 to a suspected fraudster who messaged her sweet nothings like ""I love you"" and ""I miss you"". Both Ms Chiang and Mr Ong were also commended on Wednesday. Said Mr Ong: ""We try to put ourselves in our customers' shoes.

Victims in the three separate cases lost a total of more than $3.6 million, the police said in a statement on Wednesday. Shen Tsu-kuang, 51, a former director of asset management company Linden Asset Management (Belize), is one of the three people accused. While the Taiwanese national was the director of Linden Asset Management, a BNP Paribas customer engaged the firm to handle her account with the bank. Shen had acted as a proxy for the customer, relaying instructions to the bank on her behalf. He allegedly submitted instructions purportedly signed by the BNP Paribas customer to the bank to transfer more than $2.4 million into Linden Asset Management's bank account. But the customer did not authorise these transfers. The second person accused, Singaporean Tan Chen Yen, 36, is a former banking operations specialist with Bank Pictet & Cie (Asia). He was in charge of handling physical cash stored in the bank's safe, and allegedly misappropriated about $1.2 million from the safe. To avoid detection, he replaced the misappropriated cash with counterfeit and blank notes, and manipulated the bank's accounts. Meanwhile, the third person accused, Ng Eu Hou, 27, a former loan officer with DBS Bank, allegedly deceived two victims whom he met while attending to their banking-related inquiries. The Singaporean deceived them into keying in their ATM personal identification numbers to apply for loans amounting to $4,000 in their names, without their consent or knowledge. When the victims discovered that they had received the loans, he told them that it was an error and advised them to return the amounts to the bank. He then provided details of his personal bank account, to which his victims transferred the loans. The police said in their statement that they take a serious view of financial abuse, manipulation and deception by bank employees that compromise the integrity of the banking and financial sector. "

After fleeing from the hotel in Orchard Road, Isa Ahmad followed a second female tourist into a lift at the nearby Tang Plaza later that day and robbed her of her mobile phone. The 54-year-old Singaporean pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Oct 23) to one count each of robbery and attempted aggravated rape. The court heard that Isa had earlier been convicted of multiple counts of robbery. In June 1994, he was sentenced to eight years' corrective training (CT) and 12 strokes of the cane for the offences. CT is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. The maximum period is 14 years. He continued committing robbery after his release and was last sentenced in October 2002 to 14 years of preventive detention (PD) with the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. PD is only for repeat offenders who are above 30 years old. Compared to CT, PD involves a longer period of incarceration, lasting up to 20 years. He did not learn his lesson when he was finally released in 2016, and targeted the two women on March 12, 2017. Isa, who worked as a housekeeper at Orchard Hotel Singapore, found the first victim, a 27-year-old woman, attractive and followed her into Hilton Singapore hotel. They entered the same lift and by using her key card, the woman gained access to the 16th storey, where her room was located. Just as she entered her room at around 11.30am, Isa grabbed her from behind and covered her mouth with his towel. The pair struggled and he dragged the woman by her hair to the bed. He then used his free hand to press a pillow against her face until she could not breathe momentarily. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gregory Gan said the woman managed to kick Isa and when she was able to speak, told him someone was returning to the room although she was staying there alone. Alarmed, Isa got out of the room when he heard this and the woman alerted hotel security. But before they could arrive, he knocked on her door and asked her for his towel when she opened it. She immediately closed the door, called security again and the police were alerted at 12.50pm. She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where she was found with injuries including a bruised right elbow. Later that day at around 5.30pm, Isa followed a 48-year-old woman into a lift at Tang Plaza before using a second towel to try restrain her by covering her neck and mouth. She struggled and he managed to take her mobile phone worth about $700. The woman dashed out when the lift doors opened and called the police soon after. Officers managed to trace Isa's identity and arrested him outside Orchard Hotel Singapore the next day. On Wednesday, DPP Gan urged District Judge Victor Yeo to call for a report to assess Isa's suitability for a second PD, stressing that he ""is a danger to society"". Defence lawyer K.V. Sudeep Kumar asked for Isa not to be given PD and pleaded for his client to be given 12 years' jail instead. He also said that Isa has erectile dysfunction. Judge Yeo called for a report on the suitability of PD for Isa, who is now in remand and expected to be sentenced on Nov 12. In a statement, Hilton Singapore told The Straits Times: ""The safety, security and well-being of our guests are of paramount importance and we continue to make every effort to ensure all practices and standards are in line with strict safety and security regulations."" Offenders convicted of attempted aggravated rape can be jailed for up to 10 years and caned. Isa cannot be caned, as he is over 50 years old. "

The 37-year-old, who was hauled to court last week, is already facing one charge for a similar offence. He allegedly transmitted the pornographic material through Telegram to a chat group called SG Nasi Lemak on three separate occasions in June and July. Leonard Teo Min Xuan, who is already facing one count of transmitting pornographic material by electronic means, now faces an additional charge. The 26-year-old is accused of having pornography in his electronic devices on Oct 14. The pair were among four people charged on Oct 15 with one count of transmitting obscene materials by electronic means. The other two are Abdillah Sabaruddin, 17, and Justin Lee Han Shi, 19. The two teenagers were handed an additional charge each last Friday. They are now also accused of having obscene materials on their electronic devices earlier this month. Abdillah and Lee, who were offered bail of $5,000 each, will be back in court on Nov 15. In an earlier statement, police said that the four alleged offenders were caught for their ""suspected involvement in circulating obscene materials and promoting vice activities"" through SG Nasi Lemak. The police had received several reports against the chat group between March 15 and Oct 3. Officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division managed to establish the identities of the four alleged offenders and arrested them at various locations islandwide earlier this month. More than 10 electronic devices, including a central processing unit, a laptop, a hard disk and several mobile phones, were seized as case exhibits. The chat group was used as a platform for sharing obscene photos and videos of girls in Singapore. The photos are said to include upskirt images. Screenshots of the chat group suggest there were more than 44,000 members when it was still active. Liong and Teo were not offered bail yesterday. Liong will be remanded at Woodlands Police Division and his case has been adjourned to Oct 29. Teo will be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for a psychiatric observation and will be back in court on Nov 5.

Yesterday, prosecutors sought an additional one-year jail term - the maximum stipulated under the law - in lieu of caning for the 49-year-old foreign national. But the defence contended that he should not have to serve any extra jail time. The case was adjourned to Nov 28, after the High Court allowed the defence to file an affidavit relating to whether the offender required a mattress in prison and the efficacy of a neck brace. The offender is currently serving his prison sentence and appeared in court in a wheelchair. He cannot be named as there is a gag order to protect the victim's identity. It emerged during his trial that he had injured his spine when he fell off an elephant in 2011. According to an assessment by prison doctors, the vertebral fracture and multi-level degenerative disc disease made him unfit for caning. The offender was found guilty and sentenced last year for sexually assaulting the victim at his house in October 2015. The victim, a friend of the man's youngest son, was among those invited to a Halloween party and sleepover. The boy testified that he pretended to be asleep when the man entered the room at night and touched him inappropriately. After the man left and re-entered the room, performing oral sex on him twice, the boy decided to pack his belongings. The boy then told the man that he was not feeling well and asked to phone his father to take him home. Once in the car, the boy told his father what had happened to him. When the boy's father confronted the man, the boy crouched on the car floorboard and refused to repeat the allegations because he was ""very scared"". A few days later, the boy threw away the pyjamas he wore that night. His school counsellor advised his family to call the police. The offender maintained his innocence, offering various reasons for why the boy would falsely implicate him. He suggested that the boy had lied to escape his father's wrath at having to miss the live telecast of the Rugby World Cup final to pick him up. The man also suggested that the boy had made up the allegations as a form of attention-seeking behaviour or that he had imagined the sexual assault because he was shaken by the Halloween atmosphere. However, these arguments were rejected by the trial judge as well as the Court of Appeal. In August, the apex court found that the victim had no motive to falsely accuse his friend's father of such acts. The boy's abrupt decision to go home at close to midnight after an enjoyable party was very telling, said the court. "

Things soured after the university, through its Harvard Alumni Association (HAA) office, suggested in 2014 that the club could benefit from a change of leadership which, among other things, would entail the president stepping down. But there was no change and the incumbent president, Dr Irene Lee, was voted in to lead again in November 2014. She first took office in November 2011, and had invested significant time and effort towards improving the administration and infrastructure of the club, and promoting the interests of Harvard alumni here. HAA terminated its relationship with the club in May 2015, when the leadership issue was not resolved, and now recognises the Harvard University Alumni Association of Singapore as the official Harvard alumni club here. These details emerged from a trademarks registrar's decision grounds released last week arising from Harvard University's bid to register two trademarks and the Singapore club's objections to the move. The President and Fellows of Harvard College, which constitutes Harvard University, had sought to register ""Harvard Club of Singapore"" and ""Harvard University Club of Singapore"" under the Trade Marks Act in December 2014. DECISION GROUNDS <strong>What the applicant could give, it could also take away (or indeed give another). There was no usurpation or surrender of rights.</strong> MR GABRIEL ONG SHENG LI, Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks. The applicant, Harvard University, sought to register two trademarks in Singapore, which the Harvard Club of Singapore - formed in May 1969 and whose trademark licence lasted till May 29, 2015 - objected to. Mr Ong allowed the university's applications to proceed to registration. The Singapore club objected, arguing it was an act of bad faith by the university against the club, as well as an attempt to pass off ""goodwill"" that had been built by the club over decades. Both parties agreed before Mr Gabriel Ong Sheng Li, Principal Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, that the applicant-university owned registrations for various trademarks in Singapore, including ""Harvard"", and that the goodwill attached to the Harvard name and mark also belonged to it. But the club's lawyer, Mr Wun Rizwi, argued this did not mean it was entitled to the goodwill of all variations of trademarks that contained the name Harvard. He added the club owned the goodwill attached to its full name, based on its use of Harvard Club of Singapore since 1969, when it was registered as a society. This, among other things, justified its right to prevent others, including the applicant, from registering the mark. But Harvard University, represented by lawyers Vithyashree and Jonathan Liang, countered that it ultimately owned all of this goodwill. They said that while each authorised Harvard Club may operate independently, each is a trademark licensee of the university. The law is clear that the goodwill generated in connection with the licensed name or mark would belong to the licensor, they added. Mr Ong agreed the parties were in a licensor-licensee relationship and the trademark licence spawned in May 1969 lasted till May 29, 2015. He said this licence agreement gave the opponent the right to use the university's trademarks, including among other things ""Harvard"" and ""Harvard Club"". Mr Ong made clear there was no evidence the university had any registered trademarks in Singapore in 1969, but this did not undermine his finding of a licensor-licensee relationship as the term ""trademark licence"" is wide enough to encompass common law rights as well. He said the implied trademark licence granted by the university enabled the opponent to make use of ""Harvard"" and ""Harvard Club"" without being accused of ""passing off"". He found the club had no goodwill with which to support an action of passing off against the university. He also found that the HAA had not acted in bad faith, disagreeing with the club's stance that the application was designed to pressure the president in 2014 to comply with the HAA's demands to step down, as well as interfere with the club's activities and usurp its role as a club for Harvard alumni in Singapore. Mr Ong noted the club was not a commercial licensee. ""What the applicant could give, it could also take away (or indeed give another). There was no usurpation or surrender of rights."" He allowed the university's applications to proceed to registration. It is understood the club is considering an appeal against the decision. "

While Loh is standing trial for his alleged deeds against one of the two accusers, three more charges involving the other accuser, who was 16 then, were stood down. The two accusers cannot be named due to a court order. Loh, 75, who is better known in the sports fraternity as Loh Chan Pew, has been charged with using criminal force on the female athlete when she was 18 by rubbing her genitals on two occasions while massaging the back of her thighs. Both incidents were said to have happened at the old Tampines Stadium on two Sundays between January and March 17 in 2013. Last December, Loh said under cross examination by Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Gail Wong that he knew about the allegations through Goh via their phone conversation on July 31, 2016. However, Goh disputed this then as he told the court that he did not tell Loh the names of the alleged victims over the phone. DPP Wong then told Loh that he knew the identities of the alleged victims before a police interview on Aug 2 that year because he knew what he had done to them. Loh, a former vice-president of Singapore Athletics, said then that he was ""jumping hot"" and had told Goh to tell him their identities or he would not hang up the phone. He claimed that the officer told him that two girls had made a complaint about him molesting them, and that the latter gave their names at his insistence. Back on the stand on Tuesday, Goh told the court that he had been briefed on the case on July 30, 2016. The next morning, he called the alleged victim about 10 minutes before his phone call to Loh between 9am and 9.30am. He said that he could not recall the reasons for contacting the alleged victim, but that he ""probably"" needed to clarify some details. Goh again denied providing any details about the case or identity of the alleged victims to Loh during their phone conversation. When cross-examining Goh, Lew pointed to a text message sent by the second alleged victim on July 31 at 1.10pm to a Michelle Eng that said both alleged victims had made a police report against Loh.  The message said that while the officer, who was not identified, had said he would not reveal their names, Loh had told the officer he had too many students and the officer had “no choice” but to reveal their names. When asked, Goh denied revealing their names to Loh.  Under cross examination, Goh revealed he kept a “diary” of his mobile phone calls. While he said he had called the first alleged victim before Loh, the defence claims that the officer called the alleged victim only after speaking to Loh on the phone.  Producing Goh's phone ""diary"", the defence then asked Goh to read it, with the record reflecting that an outgoing call was made to Loh at 9.24am, followed by a second call to Loh at 9.28am. The call to the first alleged victim was made at 9.33am. Lew then put it to Goh that he had told the first accuser during the call that her name ""has been leaked"", which the latter disagreed with. ""Did you tell Mr Loh the name of the complainant?"" asked Lew, which Goh denied. The defence lawyer pressed on, saying: ""Did you tell him the nature of the complaint? I put it to you that you are not telling the truth."" ""I disagree,"" said Goh. When asked to explain why he needed to call the first alleged victim immediately after speaking to Loh, Goh added that he had ""no idea and it could be that she's looking for me, but I cannot remember"". Two witnesses were also called by the prosecution for rebuttal earlier in the day. The first round of submissions by both parties has been set for Jan 3 next year, with the case to return to court for a ruling on Feb 18. "

But the defence contended that he should not have to serve any extra jail time. The case was adjourned to Nov 28, after the High Court allowed the defence to file an affidavit relating to whether the offender requires a mattress in prison and the efficacy of a neck brace. The offender is currently serving his prison sentence and appeared in court in a wheelchair. He cannot be named as there is a gag order to protect the victim's identity. It emerged during his trial that he had injured his spine when he fell off an elephant in 2011. According to an assessment by prison doctors, the vertebrae fracture and multi-level degenerative disc disease made him unfit for caning. The offender was found guilty and sentenced last year for sexually assaulting the victim at his house in October 2015. The victim, a friend of the man's youngest son, was among those invited to a Halloween party and sleepover. The boy testified that he pretended to be asleep  After the man left and re-entered the room, performing oral sex on him twice, the boy decided to pack his belongings. The boy then told the man that he was not feeling well, and asked to phone his father to take him home. Once in the car, the boy told his father what had happened to him. When the boy's father confronted the man, the boy crouched on the car floorboard and refused to repeat the allegations because he was ""very scared"". A few days later, the boy threw away the pyjamas he wore that night. It was on the advice of his school counsellor that his family called the police. The offender maintained his innocence, offering various reasons for why the boy would falsely implicate him. He suggested that the boy had lied to escape his father's wrath for having to miss the live telecast of the Rugby World Cup final to pick him up. The man also suggested that the boy had made up the allegations as a form of attention-seeking behaviour, or that he had imagined the sexual assault because he was shaken by the Halloween atmosphere. However, these arguments were rejected by the trial judge as well as the Court of Appeal. The apex court, in August, found that the victim had no motive to falsely accuse his friend's father of such acts. The boy's abrupt decision to go home at close to midnight after an enjoyable party was very telling, said the court. "

Of the 32,660 suspicious transaction reports (STRs) that were filed last year, half were alerts sent by the banking sector, with a significant percentage contributed by DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank, said the police. The two casinos contributed about 20 per cent of the total STRs filed in the same period. Their combined efforts led to or supported investigations and seizures of more than $25 million linked to various financial crimes such as cheating, criminal breach of trust and money laundering. The reports also led to the prosecution of individuals involved in the crimes, with those convicted sentenced to jail terms of between six weeks and up to nine years and six months. Taxes, penalties and fines related to the crimes amounted to more than $2 million. ""We would like to compliment the banks and casinos for their vigilance and commitment in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions,"" said director of Commercial Affairs Department David Chew.

With that, we will be able to analyse it faster, better, and then share it with the industry, so that we will have a virtuous cycle, improving the STR filings,"" he added. STRs are analysed by the department's Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office, which shares financial intelligence with law enforcement agencies in Singapore. It is Singapore's Financial Intelligence Unit, which is also headed by Mr Chew. Financial intelligence is crucial to investigations as it provides leads to commence or support investigations and can be used to develop further intelligence, identify emerging crime trends or detect possible crimes, said the police. Those who know or have reasonable grounds to suspect that any property may be connected to a criminal activity in the course of their trade, profession, or employment, are required to file an STR to the reporting office. Individuals who fail to do so may be a criminal offence, with a jail term of up to three years or a fine of up to $250,000, while entities may be fined up to $500,000. "

Lu Chor Sheng, 41, had pleaded guilty to 40 charges involving trades in the bank's system using client accounts, leading to profits of around $1.2 million to sole proprietorships set up by his friend, but whose bank accounts Lu controlled. His acts went undetected for two years, and the prosecution said he had ""grossly abused his position of trust"" to benefit himself. Lu's other offences involved two counts of cheating by personation, in which he instigated a friend of 25 years, Mr Tan Tiong Lin, to pretend to be someone else. He also faced five charges related to acquiring, possessing, using, concealing or transferring the benefits of criminal conduct. According to court documents, Lu had in 2012 a debt of about $200,000 to $300,000 from football betting and stock investment losses, and decided to place unauthorised trades in his customers' accounts to earn profits. He approached Mr Tan to incorporate two sole proprietorships - D2D Exchange and Rubik-Cube Investment - and set up business accounts with OCBC for foreign exchange investments. ""At all material time, the accused had control of the bank accounts of Rubik and D2D, along with cheques pre-signed by Tan,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutors Nicholas Khoo and Foong Leong Parn. Treasury advisers are allowed to enter foreign exchange trades only when they receive instructions from customers, and must check for existing market rates with bank traders before entering deals. But Lu did not do this. He placed trades in D2D's and Rubik's accounts at rates lower than prevailing market rates to generate larger profits. This would not have been possible if he had settled the trades with traders as required. After the profits were realised, Lu placed new trades in other customers' accounts to hide the earlier ones. He would then find ways to close customers' accounts with no profit or loss. Lu left OCBC in June 2013, but court documents said there were occasions when he instigated Mr Tan to impersonate Lu's customers to close off fraudulent trades that Lu had placed in the customers' accounts without authorisation, or to place transactions. On several occasions in 2012 and 2013, Lu also withdrew the proceeds of his unauthorised trades via cash cheques from the bank accounts of D2D and Rubik, and exchanged them for foreign currencies. Lu was found out after a corporate client had trouble making foreign exchange trades in 2013, with its account hitting a limit even though it had no outstanding deals. A check found three outstanding trades placed by Lu under the same client, without the client's knowledge, and an internal investigation found that he had executed many unauthorised trades. OCBC lodged a police report in August 2013. Yesterday, Lu was offered bail of $100,000. He is expected to start serving his sentence on Nov 8. "

On several occasions in 2012 and 2013, Lu also withdrew the proceeds of his unauthorised trades via cash cheques from the bank accounts of D2D and Rubik, and exchanged them for foreign currencies. Lu was found out after a corporate client had trouble making foreign exchange trades in 2013, with its account hitting a limit even though it had no outstanding deals. A check found three outstanding trades placed by Lu under the same client, without the client's knowledge, and an internal investigation found that Lu had executed many unauthorised trades. OCBC lodged a police report in August 2013. On Friday, he was offered bail of $100,000, and he is expected to start serving his sentence on Nov 8. "

Mike Chew Jun Yong, 37, admitted on Friday (Oct 18) to three counts of cheating and was sentenced to six months' jail. Court documents said he committed the offences with then director of the Chiropractic Focus Group (CFG) Charles Loo Boon Ann, 30, and Priscilla Tien Ling, 27, who was also a Manulife financial adviser at the time. Deputy Public Prosecutor Foong Leong Parn said they became acquainted in early 2017 and hatched a scam in which Loo would refer CFG patients seeking treatment for pre-existing conditions to Chew and Tien. The pair would sell Manulife personal accident insurance policies to the patients, who would go back to CFG and claim the cost of treatments against the policies they had bought. DPP Foong told District Judge Chee Min Ping: ""The accused and co-accused persons were aware... that the Manulife personal accident insurance policies did not cover pre-existing conditions and that the cost of the patients' treatment at CFG therefore could not be claimed against the policies. Nevertheless, the accused and co-accused persons facilitated claims made by the patients."" The court heard that Loo provided reports that stated the patients had sought treatment for injuries sustained on a date after the inception date of their Manulife insurance policies. Meanwhile, Chew and Tien submitted claims to Manulife despite knowing the details were untrue. In some cases, the pair also wrote false details in the accident claim forms to facilitate the insurance claims. The DPP said: ""The accused and Priscilla hoped that through their collaboration with Charles, they would be able to increase their customer pool and sell more insurance products to the patients referred to them by Charles. ""In addition, the accused and Priscilla hoped that they would be able to earn more commission for every successful insurance policy enrolment."" It was not mentioned in court if the patients were aware they were involved in a scam. Court documents also did not state how the offences came to light. Loo, who later left his CFG post and became its shareholder, was sentenced to eight months' jail in August. The case involving Tien is pending. Both Tien and Chew are no longer registered insurance agents. In a statement on Friday, the General Insurance Association of Singapore urged people to report suspected fraud cases with supporting evidence. Insurance fraud, estimated to cost millions a year, is committed by consumers as well as qualified professionals in the industry, said its spokesman. ""If left unaddressed, fraudulent claims will continue to drive up the cost of premiums."" For each count of cheating, Chew could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

One of them is said to have used his own urine sample to replace the one belonging to a man being tested for drug consumption. The three officers, who have been suspended since July this year, were each charged on Friday (Oct 18) with one count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice. They are accused of committing the offences at the third storey of Woodlands Checkpoint Block B on Aug 16 last year. Court statements stated that Mohamed Hafiz Lan, 41, a staff sergeant, allegedly used his own urine sample to replace the one from a man identified as Maung Moe Min. As a result, Maung passed a urine test for drugs. Court documents did not reveal his details and the outcome of his case. Abdul Rahman Kadir, a 43-year-old staff sergeant, and Muhammad Zuhairi Zainuri, a 31-year-old sergeant, are accused of engaging in a conspiracy with Hafiz to commit the offence.

In a statement, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said that law enforcement officers have the duty to maintain the rule of law and uphold justice.

Long Yun, who was part of the faculty at the university's department of chemical and biomolecular engineering, had rubbed his groin against the left thigh of a 20-year-old female student for about four minutes. The court heard that Long - who moved to Singapore from China in 2013 and became a permanent resident in 2015 - and the student were on board NUS shuttle bus service A1 in Lower Kent Ridge Road on Jan 14 at around noon. The shuttle bus is accessible to members of the public and travels from Kent Ridge MRT station to parts of the university campus. As the bus was crowded, the student, who cannot be named due to a gag order, boarded through the rear door and stood next to a pole. Long boarded through the same door and stood near the victim, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Chan. As the bus reached its next stop, Long held the pole next to the student and stood in front of her at a ""very close"" distance, said DPP Chan. When the bus moved, it jolted forward and Long's groin rubbed against the student's left thigh, leading him to be aroused. Long, who is 36 and married with an eight-year-old son, then moved closer to the student and intentionally rubbed his groin against her thigh again, the court heard. This continued until he alighted about four minutes later. The student, who was shocked and confused, realised that she had been molested and told a friend. They sought assistance from a campus security officer and referred the matter to the police. Urging the court to sentence Long to no less than 14 weeks' jail, DPP Chan disputed the defence's argument that the harm caused to the victim was minimal. Citing a victim impact statement recorded from the student on Wednesday, DPP Chan said the student now refrains from taking the campus shuttle bus out of fear of being molested again. She also has emotional breakdowns when she recalls the incident, he added. Long's lawyer T.M. Sinnadurai urged the court to sentence his client, a first-time offender, to eight weeks in jail. Mr Sinnadurai said the offence was not premeditated and that his client had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He said that Long has ""demonstrated sincere remorse"", attending counselling sessions to rehabilitate himself and offered compensation to the student. In response to queries from The Straits Times, an NUS spokesman said Long's employment was terminated in February after an internal investigation. A university pastoral staff member supported the student from the time she reported the incident until care was no longer required, the spokesman added. ""We take a very serious view of staff misconduct, and disciplinary action will be taken against those who have breached our staff code of conduct,"" he said. "

Ler, 38, whose nine-day trial spanned five months, was sentenced to 15 months in jail on two charges: Possession of a drug-stained syringe, and a charge of injecting methamphetamine into a Sim Eng Chee last year. Ler was arrested with Sim, a convicted drug abuser, at Conrad Centennial Singapore hotel on March 2 last year, after hotel staff found drugs in Sim's hotel room and called the police. During Ler's sentencing yesterday, District Judge Christopher Goh said this was ""a tale of drug consumption and sex that unravelled"" for Ler as the other ""protagonist"", Sim, did not realise he was assigned to a new hotel room. Hotel staff thus found drugs while Sim was out procuring more drugs, the district judge said. Sim earlier testified in court that he had hired Ler for ""slamming"" services - slang for the administration of illegal drugs via injection - ahead of group sex sessions with other men. But Ler countered that he had provided ""massage services"" to Sim. District Judge Goh said he found Sim's testimony more believable than Ler's, as his evidence was consistent with the text messages between the two, and he came across as one who has seen the error of his ways. Sim answered the questions clearly and to the point, even when what he said might have caused him embarrassment, added the district judge. But Ler's claim of providing massage services was not raised in his statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau, said the district judge. ""I found his attempts to explain drug references in the text messages difficult to accept,"" he said. For example, Ler had claimed that the ""coke"" mentioned in their text messages referred to the soft drink Coca-Cola, while the ""poke"" was in reference to the Facebook ""poke"" function. ""I was, in fact, incredulous at some of these explanations,"" said District Judge Goh. He also rejected Ler's explanations for the drug-stained syringe found on him. Ler first claimed that the syringe was used to flush food particles out of his teeth, then later said it was from his former partner Mikhy Farrera-Brochez's study. ""I agree with the prosecution that this explanation was an afterthought,"" said the district judge. In calling for a sentence of 15 months in jail, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Wuan said Ler had committed the offences for greed, and had done ""precisely what a doctor ought not to do"". ""His commission of the offences at the expense of others is abhorrent,"" said DPP Wuan. District Judge Goh added that a sentence of 15 months in jail was fair, and that the prosecution, who included Deputy Public Prosecutor Desmond Chong, had made a concession by not requesting the sentences to run consecutively. This sentence will run after Ler finishes serving his two-year term for helping HIV-positive Farrera-Brochez cheat the authorities into issuing a work pass. Ler and Farrera-Brochez are at the centre of a HIV Registry scandal, in which the details of 14,200 HIV-positive patients were leaked online. <strong>Correction note</strong> "

Ahmed Hussein Abdul Kadir Sheik Uduman is the first Singaporean national to be sentenced for terrorism financing. Yesterday, Ahmed pleaded guilty in a district court to two charges in connection with two payments he made amounting to about $1,145 in total to an individual who was ""facilitating terrorist acts"" overseas. The court heard that Ahmed had become radicalised some time in 2013 after he came to know of the website and YouTube channel of Sheikh Abdullah al-Faisal, a radical preacher living in Jamaica. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Chong Yonghui said Ahmed was aware that the preacher supported physical jihad, including the use of violence against ""intruders"", who were described as ""non-Muslims attacking a Muslim area or location"". The preacher also said it was an obligation for Muslims to set up a Muslim caliphate, and commended the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) for doing this through violence. Ahmed agreed with the preacher's religious ideology and reached out to him, said DPP Chong. The duo communicated via Facebook, e-mail and the messaging app WhatsApp. Ahmed then discovered he could donate money to the preacher, and did so in July 2016 by transferring $1,059 to a ""Patrick Gray"", who was collecting donations on the man's behalf. The second sum of US$62 (S$85) was transferred to the preacher's wife on Sept 3 that year. Ahmed was arrested by the Internal Security Department in July last year, and was detained under the Internal Security Act as he was found to be radicalised and wanted to undertake armed violence in Syria in support of ISIS. ""The present facts highlight starkly the dangers of terrorist propaganda and its insidious far-reaching effects,"" said DPP Chong, who called for a deterrent sentence. ""It cannot be overstated that the funding of terrorist propaganda which preaches violent religious ideology must be clamped down upon unequivocally,"" he added. ""In so doing, Singapore continues to fulfil her duty as a member of the global community in the unending fight against terrorism."" Ahmed, who was not represented, pleaded for leniency, adding that he had a mother who has dementia and a young son. He told the court that he wants to be a good citizen of Singapore upon his release. For terrorism financing, Ahmed could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined $500,000. "

In sentencing him, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt noted that the case involved ""serious sexual offences"" and that the offender had shown ""gross abuse of authority"". Judge Chay convicted the now 57-year-old man in August after a trial. He had found the offender guilty of three counts of sexually exploiting a minor and five counts of carnal intercourse. The man, who has been suspended from duty, cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity. The boy and his mother arrived here from China in 1999 when he was about nine years old. The victim is now 30 years old and a Singaporean. In his submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew had earlier said the victim was a Primary 5 pupil in 2003 when he reported to the man every morning as he was the school's vice-head prefect. They were in their school gym some time that year when the man sexually stimulated the boy. The boy became the head prefect the following year and accepted the vice-principal's offer of one-to-one English tuition at the man's Woodlands flat. The man would then sexually stimulate the teenager after lessons. During the trial in March last year, the victim testified that his mother was repatriated around 2002 for working illegally in Singapore and he had to live with a relative here. When the relative could no longer be his guardian after the Primary School Leaving Examination in 2004, he moved in with the vice-principal who became his guardian. The man continued to commit sexual acts on the victim until 2006 and the activities progressed to involve oral sex. DPP Chew had said the victim started becoming more resistant to the man's advances in 2007. However, he would still give in due to pressure from the man. In 2013, they went on a trip to Scandinavia together, where the victim met a woman whom he later married. He moved into her home in Singapore later that year, added DPP Chew. In 2015, the victim happened to meet the vice-principal's niece and told her about his ordeal. She encouraged him to lodge a police report. The victim finally alerted the police in November that year. In an earlier statement, the Ministry of Education said the offender has been suspended from duty since December 2015 and is not deployed at any school. The man, who intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence, is now out on bail of $30,000. "

The employer cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity. But when a second police officer recorded a further statement from Lamneithiem at around 1.20pm on April 24, the maid changed her account again and said that the act was non-consensual. About six hours later, a third policeman recorded another statement from the maid as she had given contradictory accounts, the court heard. This time, she told the officer that her employer had ""forcefully"" raped her. The officer contacted the employer, who had his statement recorded the next day. The DPP said this took about 1 hour and 50 minutes. The employer also had to surrender his passport to the police, and his mobile phone was seized. He was further investigated for about three hours over the maid's allegations. Lamneithiem finally came clean about the false rape allegation on May 31.

The Keppel Bay View property was eventually sold by DBS Bank for $3.85 million. The sale netted balance proceeds of more than $420,900 that would ordinarily have been paid out to Ms Chan, 74, the co-founder of luxury watch retailer The Hour Glass, and Ms Sabrina Tay. But complications arose when the potential buyers successfully sued Ms Chan and Ms Tay over the aborted deal, and Ms Chan was made bankrupt by other creditors, leading to competing claims over the proceeds. Yesterday, the High Court ruled that Ms Chan's half-share of the proceeds would be paid to the Official Assignee (OA), which administers the affairs of bankrupts and distributes assets to creditors. Ms Tay's share has been released to the potential buyers, named in court documents as Mr Davis Colin Niel and Ms Kim Ji Soo. In his judgment, Justice Choo Han Teck said the potential buyers have a legal right over the proceeds only to the extent of their $187,750 deposit. As Ms Tay's half-share of $210,471.52 has been paid to them, the buyers have no security over the remainder of the disputed sum, said the judge. He said if the buyers want to pursue the rest of their $212,163.66 claim against Ms Chan, they must file proofs of debt with the OA. <strong>The buyers argued that in addition to the judgment sum, they should get another $95,000 as the appreciation in the price of the property. But the judge said the buyers, having obtained damages for the breach of the option, can no longer be regarded as the owners of the property and are therefore not entitled to the appreciation in value.</strong> The buyers were granted an option to purchase the flat for $3.755 million on Sept 17 last year. They exercised the option on Sept 28 that year. The deal was not completed, after a bankruptcy application was filed against Ms Chan on Nov 2. The buyers sued Ms Chan and Ms Tay for the return of the deposit and damages for breach of the option, and won a judgment sum of $212,163.66. The apartment was sold by DBS on May 13 this year. Two weeks after the mortgagee sale, Ms Chan was declared bankrupt, which meant her assets were vested in the OA as her trustee. DBS filed an application asking the High Court to determine the competing claims to the balance proceeds of $420,943.04. It was agreed that Ms Tay was entitled to half the sum, but Ms Chan's share remained in dispute. The Comptroller of Income Tax initially laid claim to part of the disputed sum, as Ms Chan owes $141,946.88 in income tax. But the taxman later said it would defer to the OA's determination and filed two proofs of debt with the OA. The buyers argued that their claim should be paid in priority to all other creditors. They also argued that in addition to the judgment sum, they should get another $95,000 as the appreciation in the price of the property. But the judge said the buyers, having obtained damages for the breach of the option, can no longer be regarded as the owners of the property and are therefore not entitled to the appreciation in value. Ms Chan recently completed a two-week jail term for contempt of court, while her older daughter Audrey, 45, is serving a 22-month term for drug offences. "

The setting up of the watch group comes amid a sharp jump in the number of cases of rioting, affray and serious hurt at nightspots. They rose to 56 cases in the first eight months of this year, compared with 36 for the same period last year. In addition, the regional terrorist threat remains high, with crowded places being attractive targets for terrorists, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Amrin Amin yesterday, at the launch of the second iteration of the Smart Clubbing Campaign. The Public Entertainment Industry Safety and Security Watch Group, which comprises 21 PE outlets, four associated partners and the police, will promote information sharing on nightspot-related crimes islandwide and potential security threats, he added. Participating PE nightspots in the group can also act as ""additional eyes and ears for each other, and help to look out for one another"", said Mr Amrin. ""For example, if there are potential troublemakers or suspicious characters in the vicinity, such information can be quickly shared with each other, and police may also be alerted early to keep the patrons safe,"" he added. He cited how Singapore River One, which manages the Singapore River precinct that includes Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay, has created a dedicated WhatsApp chat group with its PE nightspots to allow rapid sharing of information on safety and security matters. Meanwhile, other nightspots such as Bar Rouge at Swissotel The Stamford have implemented policies to not serve alcoholic drinks to highly intoxicated persons. Mr Amrin also noted that nightspots Zouk and Bang Bang have set up holding areas on their premises for highly intoxicated people to rest and sober up. ""For their patrons' safety, these PE nightspots help ensure that they are not left alone on the street in an intoxicated state,"" said Mr Amrin. He added that these measures not only benefit the patrons but also enhance the image, reputation and business of the local nightlife industry, and said he hopes that all PE nightspots will adopt similar practices ""in time to come"". Marina Bay Sands, which houses Singapore's largest nightclub, Marquee, told The Straits Times it has implemented similar safety measures, such as a ""recovery bay"" for patrons to rest and recuperate or seek medical assistance if needed. The Smart Clubbing Campaign was first launched in September last year by the police, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, to tackle an increase in crimes such as outrage of modesty, theft and violent crimes at PE nightspots. Since then, there has been a decline of 17 per cent in the number of outrage of modesty cases, as well as a decline of 26 per cent in the number of theft cases at PE nightspots, according to police statistics.

The four, who appeared in court via video link, are Abdillah Sabaruddin, 17; Justin Lee Han Shi, 19; Leonard Teo Min Xuan, 26; and Liong Tianwei, 37.

More than 10 electronic devices, including a central processing unit, a laptop, a hard disk and several mobile phones, were seized as case exhibits. Reports earlier this month said the chat group was used as a platform for sharing obscene photos and videos of Singaporean girls. The photos were said to include upskirt images. Screenshots of the chat group suggested that there were more than 44,000 members when it was still active. According to Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao, the chat group was set up more than a year ago, but its membership numbers spiked in recent months with more people becoming aw-are of it. They had to pay $30 as an ""entry fee"". On Sept 30, a Twitter user condemned the group on the social media platform as she was mentioned in the Telegram chat group. This prompted many other Twitter users to express their disgust at the content being circulated in SG Nasi Lemak. In the statement, the police advised members of the public not to solicit on any lewd websites or join such online platforms and illicit chat groups. The police added that they take a serious view of anyone involved in criminal activities and will continue to take tough enforcement action against those breaking the law. All four accused are remanded at Woodlands Police Division and will be back in court next Tuesday. "

The police had received several reports against the chat group between March 15 and Oct 3 this year. Officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division managed to establish the identities of the four alleged offenders and arrested them at various locations islandwide on Monday. More than 10 electronic devices, including a central processing unit, a laptop, a hard disk and several mobile phones, were seized as case exhibits. Reports earlier this month said the chat group was used as a platform for sharing obscene photos and videos of Singaporean girls. The photos are said to include upskirt images. Screenshots of the chat group suggest there were more than 44,000 members when it was still active. According to Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao, the chat group was set up more than a year ago, but its membership numbers spiked in recent months with more people becoming aware of it. They had to pay $30 as an ""entry fee"". On Sept 30, a Twitter user condemned the group on the social media platform as she was mentioned in the Telegram chat group. This prompted many other Twitter users to express their disgust at the content being circulated in SG Nasi Lemak. In the statement, police advised members of the public not to solicit in any lewd websites or join such online platforms and illicit chat groups. They added that the police take a ""serious view of anyone involved in criminal activities and will continue to take tough enforcement actions against those breaking the law"". All four accused are remanded at Woodlands Police Division and will be back in court on Oct 22. Liong is represented by lawyer Tan Hee Joek while the three others are unrepresented. Offenders convicted of transmitting obscene materials by electronic means can be jailed for up to three months and fined. "

Singapore permanent resident Xu Kai Xiang, 27, was fined $1,400 and banned from driving for a year for the two charges. Although he initially faced a third charge of causing the deaths of the pedestrians by driving dangerously on April 23 last year, Xu was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, pending the outcome of a coroner's inquiry into the deaths. This means Xu can still be prosecuted for the offence later, depending on the evidence that emerges. At the time of the accident, Xu was working as a safety supervisor for his father's construction company, Chang Fu, and was driving the company lorry to collect a parcel. At around 9.30am, Xu was driving along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 towards Marymount Road when the vehicle ploughed into three pedestrians - Mr Chua Cheng Thong, 86, his daughter Gina Chua Aye Wah, 58, and a family friend, Mr Yap Soon Huat, 63. All three were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Xu, who was injured in the accident, had a Class 3A driving licence but not the Class 3 licence required to drive the lorry. He had previously applied for and obtained a Class 3 provisional driving licence, but chose instead to take his practical driving test in automatic transmission vehicles. This meant he could get only the Class 3A driving licence, which he obtained on Aug 21, 2017. However, Xu did not tell his father that he had only a Class 3A licence. Believing that his son possessed a Class 3 licence, the elder Mr Xu allowed him to drive his personal car and the company lorry. Xu joined his father's company full-time in February last year, and began driving the company's workers off-site daily from April 8 that year. He could have been fined up to $1,000 or jailed for up to three months for each count of driving without a licence and driving without insurance. "

Kalaimani Muniandy, 60, was charged with causing the death of Madam Mok Fei Chen, a 35-year-old Malaysian who worked for technology company Hewlett-Packard in Singapore. He is accused of failing to keep proper control of the Malaysia-registered vehicle along a ramp near the arrival hall of Tuas Checkpoint at around 4.20am on Feb 26. The bus hit the walls of the ramp and Madam Mok was one of two women flung out of the vehicle. Both fell from the ramp, about three storeys high, to the ground below. Madam Mok died of multiple injuries at the scene while the other woman, who was 21 at the time, survived. Kalaimani is also accused of causing hurt to nine passengers and grievous hurt to two others by driving in a negligent manner that morning. A coroner's inquiry in August into Madam Mok's death found that she was travelling on the bus from Johor with 15 other people - mostly her colleagues - when the accident occurred. Her husband, Mr Tai She Chun, 38, was also in the bus. Coroner Marvin Bay ruled Madam Mok's death to be a ""tragic traffic misadventure"". The coroner had also said that the bus could not be tested after the accident as its operational components were damaged. He noted, however, that the vehicle had been maintained regularly and was inspected just two days before the tragedy. Kalaimani's bail was set at $10,000 on Saturday and he will be back in court on Friday. If convicted of causing Madam Mok's death by negligent driving, he can be jailed for up to two years and fined.

Le Tallec, 47, will also be disqualified from driving for four years after her release. The Singapore permanent resident, who is the sister of human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pleaded guilty yesterday to drink driving, using a car without a Singapore Class 3 driving licence, and driving without insurance. A fourth charge of taking the vehicle, which belonged to Le Tallec's husband, without the owner's consent was taken into consideration. This carries a fine of up to $1,000 or jail term of up to three months. If her husband had given her consent, he may also be liable for the offences as the owner of the vehicle under the Road Traffic Act. The court heard that on the night of May 13 this year, Le Tallec drove her husband's BMW X5 to a restaurant in Dempsey Road, where she had two glasses of wine and a glass of champagne. While driving home with a friend, she was stopped at a police roadblock in Holland Road towards Ulu Pandan at around 2.30am. When she stopped the car, Staff Sergeant (SSG) Alvin Lee noticed that Le Tallec appeared to have difficulty finding the car's handbrake. He also noted that she smelled strongly of alcohol and could not answer his question promptly when he asked her where she had driven from, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Magdalene Huang. Le Tallec also accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal while reaching for her bag in the rear passenger seat to retrieve her driving licence, and SSG Lee quickly alerted her to it, DPP Huang added. Le Tallec subsequently failed a breathalyser test at the roadblock, and was arrested and taken to Central Police Division for a breath analysing device test at about 4.20am. It found that she had 95 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath - almost triple the prescribed limit of 35 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath. This is her second drink-driving conviction in Singapore. Her first offence in 2013 saw her disqualified from driving for two years. However, she did not reapply for a Class 3 driving licence in Singapore after that, said DPP Huang. She also has other traffic-related offences, specifically for careless driving in 2010 and inconsiderate driving in 2004, the court heard. For drink driving, DPP Huang urged District Judge Lorraine Ho to sentence Le Tallec to three weeks' jail and a fine of $5,000 and to disqualify her from driving for three years. Calling for a deterrent sentence, DPP Huang said Le Tallec does not have a clean driving record. She also said Le Tallec's ability to drive had been impaired as she had difficulty finding the handbrake and had accidentally stepped on the accelerator while at the roadblock. Le Tallec's lawyer Shashi Nathan said his client was ""genuinely remorseful"". He said the mother of four realised she had made a terrible mistake, and has been suffering the consequences from the ""unwarranted publicity (of her case) for reasons beyond her control"". According to previous media reports, Le Tallec was an events planner before she started her own fashion line, Totally Tala. She lived in New York City before marrying a businessman based in Singapore, but reportedly remarried later to an Italian businessman. "

Lim Ah Bah, 73, faces four charges in total, the most of all the accused. He was charged with two counts each of molestation and insulting a woman's modesty. These cases are said to involve the same victim - a 40-year-old woman. Lim allegedly committed all the offences at the Xin Hua TCM Clinic, which is at the 100 AM mall in Tanjong Pagar, at around 1pm on Oct 1 last year. It was not stated in court documents if he was working there at the time. Lim allegedly touched the woman's private parts through her pants and asked her to apply some lubricating gel there. According to court documents, he is also accused of touching her breasts and asking her ""inappropriate questions"" pertaining to her sex life. Separately, 75-year-old Yan Kok Fatt was in court for allegedly molesting a 21-year-old woman at the Midpoint Orchard shopping centre at around 12.30pm on June 4. He is said to have touched her breast and stomach over her clothes. The other five men are Loh Wai Cheong, 26; Muhammad Salihin Omar, 31; Ng Soon Hee, 47; Haji Mohamed Yusoof, 54; and a Singaporean who allegedly molested his domestic helper on three separate occasions in March. The 48-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order on the maid's identity, allegedly touched her left breast, among other acts, in a Serangoon Avenue 2 flat. As for Ng, he allegedly touched a 26-year-old woman's breast at a sheltered walkway near Block 173 Gangsa Road in Bukit Panjang at around 2pm on March 22. He is also accused of insulting her modesty by making a lewd comment about her body. Loh, Salihin and Yusoof face one charge of molestation each. Loh allegedly molested a 24-year-old woman at Orchard MRT station at around 3pm on June 5, while Salihin is said to have outraged a 20-year-old woman's modesty at the monorail platform of Resorts World Station on Sentosa the following month. In a statement on Sunday, police said Yusoof allegedly molested a 31-year-old woman in a taxi in Lorong Ah Soo, near Upper Paya Lebar Road, on Jan 4. It was not stated if he was the driver then. Lim and the 48-year-old man were each offered bail of $10,000. The five other men had their bails set at $5,000 each. The cases involving the 48-year-old and Loh have been adjourned to next month. The other five men will be back in court later this month. The first half of this year saw a 5 per cent increase in the number of molestation cases. Police statistics showed that from January to June, there were 837 such cases, up from 797 in the same period last year. "

The mental condition ""significantly impaired"" the judgment of businessman Lim Chai Heng, 56, leading him to discount the risks of his actions, despite signs of danger and warnings from his son, who was in the car with him, stated an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report. Lim told an IMH psychiatrist that when he saw cars and motorcycles coming towards him, he ""knew finished already"" and that ""if not others hit (him), (he) will hit others"". The underlying cause of the psychosis remains unclear. Lim pleaded guilty yesterday to a charge of causing death by a rash act, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a fine. Prosecutors sought at least two years in jail and a 12-year driving ban, while the defence asked for five to seven months in jail and an eight-year ban. Another four charges - three for causing grievous hurt and one for causing hurt - will be considered when he is sentenced at a later date. Lim was originally charged with causing death by dangerous driving. The charge was upgraded to culpable homicide before it was amended to the current charge. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" delta=""1"" element=""1"" fid=""813831"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2019/10/14/hzbenz1014a.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" width=""780""/><br/><figcaption>The Mercedes-Benz that ploughed into oncoming traffic on the Ayer Rajah Expressway.

PHOTO: LIM WEE TECK</figcaption><br/></figure> The court heard that on the morning of Dec 19, 2016, Lim was driving his son from their Hougang home to drop him off at his new workplace in Depot Road. Along the Central Expressway, when Lim drove past the Braddell Road exit, his son asked why he did not take the exit to avoid paying Electronic Road Pricing charges. Lim replied: ""Do not be afraid. I know the way."" But instead of getting out at the Jalan Bukit Merah exit, which was the closest to the destination, Lim continued driving into the AYE towards Tuas. Ignoring his son's repeated requests to exit the AYE, Lim skipped another 14 exits and accused the younger man of not trusting him. After travelling about 23km, Lim reached the Tuas Checkpoint and drove into the motorcycle lane. He then made a three-point turn and drove on as oncoming vehicles avoided him. When he entered the AYE, he accelerated to a speed of 126kmh to 147kmh, speeding down the slope towards the Tuas West underpass. Motorist Tan Han Boon, now 37, swerved, causing his Mazda 6 to collide with a bus before hitting a concrete wall. Lim's car then collided with a Toyota Vios driven by artist Jackie Liong Kuo Hwa, 38, whose wife Venny Oliver, now 40, was in the front passenger seat. The impact sent the Toyota slamming against the wall. Lim's car then crashed into a scooter, causing rider Teh Tze Yong and his wife Choo Yat Chiam, both now 37, who was riding pillion, to be flung from the vehicle. The Mercedes finally came to a halt after hitting the wall. Mr Liong died at the scene from multiple injuries. Ms Oliver, Mr Teh and Ms Choo suffered multiple fractures, while Mr Tan suffered multiple abrasions. No mechanical defects were found on Lim's car. The damaged bus cost more than $27,000 to repair, while the other three vehicles were scrapped. The damaged wall cladding on the AYE was repaired at a cost of more than $1,300. Referring to sentencing guidelines, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan argued that but for Lim's mental condition, he would be facing a starting-point jail term of at least 41/2 years for showing an ""extremely high degree of rashness"". The DPP said Lim should be jailed at least two years, after taking into account his mental condition and applying a discount for his guilty plea. Defence counsel Yusfiyanto Yatiman argued that Lim was remorseful and a first offender, and that his acute psychosis had diluted his culpability. "

The CBT charge refers to Jeffrey Ong Su Aun's time at law firm JLC Advisors, where he allegedly misappropriated more than US$4.85 million (S$6.6 million) on Oct 23, 2017. The three other new charges are for forgery for the purpose of cheating, which Ong allegedly committed on Aug 7 last year. Ong, 42, who is now in remand, appeared in court yesterday via video link. The court heard that he had allegedly forged bank statements for the months of April to June last year to dupe a lawyer from another firm, Mr Chan Yi Zhang, into believing that monies linked to the CBT charge were still present and unused. The cash was linked to a settlement between two companies - Airtrust Singapore and Wrangwell. It was then held by JLC Advisors in escrow, which is an essential service in capital markets that support transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. Ong now faces 26 charges in all, including cheating, but Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Khoo told the court that the man may face more charges later. Ong first made the headlines earlier this year after more than $33 million that was held in escrow by JLC Advisors for client Allied Technologies went missing. He disappeared soon after. Court documents do not state if the cases involving precision engineering firm Allied Technologies are related to the matters involving Airtrust Singapore and Wrangwell. It emerged in court earlier that Ong had left Singapore for Malaysia in a private-hire car on May 13. He then went to a hotel in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, and became uncontactable on May 16 after getting rid of his mobile phone. He stayed at the hotel until officers from the Royal Malaysia Police arrested him on May 29. He was found to be in possession of a stolen Malaysian passport which he had obtained from a friend known only as Calvin. The passport had been issued to a 43-year-old man who bore some resemblance to Ong, as the passport photo showed. Police believed that Ong had the knowledge and means to abscond. He was brought back to Singapore on May 30 and charged with one count of cheating two days later. He faced more charges in court in the following months. His case has been adjourned to Nov 25. If convicted of criminal breach of trust as an attorney, he can either be jailed for life, or be jailed for up to 20 years and fined. "

They were then sent PDF documents that instructed them to pay MinLaw or MAS, or both, a deposit and 7 per cent goods and services tax for the loan before it can be approved. The intention was to fool the victims into believing that they were in contact with a licensed moneylender, police said. Some victims also received another PDF document tricking them into thinking that their loan requests had been processed. When the victims refused to make payments, the scammers would harass them, claiming that the loans had already been approved and a processing fee would be incurred if the loans were cancelled. Police said that a licensed moneylender is not allowed to make any cold calls or send unsolicited text messages to members of the public. It is also lawfully obliged to verify the identity and particulars of the borrower at the moneylender's office. A licensed moneylender will also not ask for any payment to be made before a loan is disbursed, or for securing the loan's disbursement. An administrative fee may be charged after the loan has been granted, but this is usually deducted from the loan principal. "

Lim Ah Bah, 73, faces four charges in total, the most of all the accused. He is charged with two counts each of molestation and insulting a woman's modesty. These cases are said to involve the same victim - a 40-year-old woman. Lim allegedly committed all the offences at Xin Hua TCM Clinic, which is at the 100 AM mall in Tanjong Pagar, at around 1pm on Oct 1 last year. It was not stated in court documents if he was working there at the time. Lim allegedly touched the woman's private parts over her pants and asked her to apply some lubricating gel there. According to court documents, he is also accused of touching her breasts and asking her ""inappropriate questions"" pertaining to her sex life. Separately, 75-year-old Yan Kok Fatt was in court for allegedly molesting a 21-year-old woman at Midpoint Orchard shopping centre at around 12.30pm on June 4 this year. He is said to have touched her breast and stomach over her clothes. The other five men are: Loh Wai Cheong, 26; Muhammad Salihin Omar, 31; Ng Soon Hee, 47; Haji Mohamed Yusoof, 54; and a Singaporean who allegedly molested his domestic helper on three separate occasions in March. The 48-year-old man, who cannot be named owing to a gag order on the maid's identity, allegedly touched her left breast, among other acts, in a Serangoon Avenue 2 flat. As for Ng, he allegedly touched a 26-year-old woman's breast along a sheltered walkway near Block 173 Gangsa Road in Bukit Panjang at around 2pm on March 22. Ng is also accused of insulting her modesty by making a lewd comment about her body. Loh, Salihin and Yusoof face one charge of molestation each. Loh allegedly molested a 24-year-old woman at Orchard MRT station at around 3pm on June 5, while Salihin is said to have outraged a 20-year-old woman's modesty at the monorail platform of Resorts World station in Sentosa the following month. In a statement on Sunday, police said that Yusoof allegedly molested a 31-year-old woman in a taxi along Lorong Ah Soo near Upper Paya Lebar Road on Jan 4. It was not mentioned if he was the driver at the time. Lim and the 48-year-old man were each offered bail of $10,000. The five other men had their bails set at $5,000 each. The cases involving the 48-year-old man and Loh have been adjourned to next month. The other five men will be back in court later this month. In the statement, police said that outrage of modesty cases have been on the increase and remain a key concern. Offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. Those above 50 will not be caned because of their age. The first half of this year saw a slight increase of about 5 per cent in the number of molestation cases. Statistics released by the police  showed that from January to June, there were a total of 837 such cases, up from 797 in the same period last year. "

Lim told an IMH psychiatrist that when he saw cars and motorcycles coming towards him, he ""knew finished already"" and that ""if not others hit (him), (he) will hit others"". The underlying cause of the psychosis remains unclear. Lim pleaded guilty on Monday to a charge of causing death by a rash act, an offence that carries a maximum sentence of five years' jail and a fine. Prosecutors sought at least two years' jail and a 12-year driving ban, while the defence asked for five to seven months' jail and an eight-year ban. Another four charges - three for causing grievous hurt and one for causing hurt - will be taken into consideration when he is sentenced at a later date. Lim was originally charged with causing death by dangerous driving. The charge was  The court heard that on the morning of Dec 19, 2016, Lim was driving his son from their Hougang home to drop him off at his new workplace in Depot Road. Along the Central Expressway (CTE), when Lim drove past the Braddell Road exit, his son asked why he did not take the exit to avoid paying Electronic Road Pricing charges. Lim replied: ""Do not be afraid, I know the way."" But instead of getting out at the Jalan Bukit Merah exit, which was the closest to the destination, Lim continued driving onto the AYE towards Tuas. Ignoring his son's repeated requests to exit the AYE, Lim skipped another 14 exits and accused the younger man of not trusting him. After travelling about 23km, Lim reached the Tuas Checkpoint and drove into the motorcycle lane. After stopping for two minutes, he made a three-point turn before driving back against the flow of traffic. He merged into the car lane and continued driving as oncoming vehicles avoided him. When he entered the AYE, he accelerated to a speed of 126kmh to 147kmh, speeding down the slope towards the Tuas West underpass. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" delta=""1"" element=""1"" fid=""813831"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2019/10/14/hzbenz1014a.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" width=""780""/><br/><figcaption>The Mercedes-Benz that ploughed into oncoming traffic on the Ayer Rajah Expressway.

Mr Tan's car collided with a bus before hitting a concrete wall. Lim's car, which was going at more than 137kmh, then collided head-on with a Toyota Vios driven by actor Jackie Liong Kuo Hwa, 38, whose wife Venny Oliver, now 40, was in the front passenger seat. The impact sent the Toyota tilting to a vertical position and slamming against the wall. Lim's car then crashed into a scooter, causing rider Teh Tze Yong and his pillion-riding wife Choo Yat Chiam, both now 37, to be flung from the vehicle. The Mercedes finally came to halt after hitting the wall. Mr Liong  No mechanical defects were found on Lim's car. The bus cost more than $27,000 to repair, while the other three vehicles were scrapped. The damaged wall cladding on the AYE was repaired at a cost of more than $1,300. Referring to sentencing guidelines for the offence, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan argued that but for Lim's mental condition, he would be facing a starting point jail term of at least 4½ years. Lim displayed an extremely high degree of rashness, amounting to blatant disregard for human life, caused more harm than would ordinarily have been expected of the offence, and breached multiple traffic regulations, the DPP argued. The DPP said Lim should be jailed at least two years, after adjusting the starting point downwards to take into account his mental condition and applying a discount for his guilty plea. Defence counsel Yusfiyanto Yatiman disagreed with the DPP's approach in arriving at the appropriate sentence. He argued that Lim was remorseful and a first offender, and that his acute psychosis had diluted his culpability. "

The cash was linked to a settlement between two firms - trading company Airtrust Singapore and Wrangwell. It was then held by JLC Advisors in escrow, which is an essential service in capital markets that support transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. Ong now faces 26 charges in all, including cheating, but Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Khoo told the court that he may face more charges later. Ong first made the headlines earlier this year after more than $33 million that was held in escrow by JLC Advisors for client Allied Technologies went missing. He disappeared soon after. Court documents do not state if the cases involving precision-engineering firm Allied Technologies are related to the matters involving Airtrust Singapore and Wrangwell. It emerged in court earlier that Ong had left Singapore for Malaysia in a private-hire car on May 13 after making arrangements with a friend known only as Nicholas. In Malaysia, he met with one Dennis, a friend of Nicholas. Dennis initially took Ong to his office where the lawyer stayed for two or three days, Singapore police investigations revealed. Ong then moved to a hotel in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, and became uncontactable on May 16 after he got rid of his mobile phone. He stayed at the hotel until officers from the Royal Malaysia Police arrested him on May 29. Ong was found to be in possession of a stolen Malaysian passport which he had obtained from another friend known only as Calvin. The passport had been issued to a 43-year-old man whose photograph bore some resemblance to Ong. Police believed Ong had the knowledge and means to abscond. Ong was brought back to Singapore on May 30 and charged with one count of cheating two days later. He faced more charges in court in the following months. Ong’s case has been adjourned to Nov 25. If convicted of criminal breach of trust as an attorney, he can either be jailed for life or jailed for up to 20 years and fined. "

In the first case, Koh Kok Huat and Adrian Yeo, directors of both Foster Asia Pacific and Ematco Industrial, have been sentenced to three weeks' jail each for evading income taxes by not declaring company bonuses they received. Koh and Yeo have also been ordered to pay $93,086 and $68,797 in penalties respectively for their tax offences, said the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) in a statement on Friday (Oct 11). They faced three charges in court on Friday for making false entries in their income tax returns with the wilful intent to evade tax. They pleaded guilty to one charge, with two other charges taken into consideration during sentencing. Foster Asia Pacific and Ematco Industrial both sell industrial materials in the marine industry. Iras said that for the years of assessment between 2011 and 2013, Koh and Yeo did not declare bonuses totalling $337,000 and $280,360, which resulted in $64,805 and $49,680 in taxes undercharged respectively. Investigations revealed that the pair would decide how much bonus was to be paid to themselves. The payment vouchers from these bonus were called ""subcontractor fees"" and placed under the ""subcontractor fees"" account in the businesses’ financial records. Iras warned that there will be severe penalties for those who wilfully evade tax and it will not hesitate to bring offenders to court. Offenders may face a penalty of up to four times the amount of tax evaded and jail terms may be imposed. In another tax evasion case on Friday, a director of an information technology firm was sentenced to four weeks' jail and ordered to pay a $147,795 penalty for evading the goods and services tax (GST). Arthur Yeo Yao Zhi, director of Orynix, pleaded guilty in court on Friday to two charges of GST evasion which amounted to $77,230 in fraudulent refunds between March and September 2012, said Iras in another statement. Two other charges of tax fraud were taken into consideration for sentencing. Orynix was an IT consultancy company which provided system maintenance, IT solutions and IT infrastructure management services to clients. Arthur Yeo is the sole director and shareholder of the company. Investigations revealed that he was solely responsible for the company's business operations, which include sourcing for sales, issuing tax invoices, collecting payments from customers, making orders and payments to suppliers. Iras warned that any person found guilty of wilfully submitting false GST returns by overstating any input tax, understating any output tax or including fictitious transactions can face a penalty of three times the amount of tax undercharged. They can also receive a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment of up to seven years, or both. Informants of these offences can receive a reward based on 15 per cent of the tax recovered, capped at $100,000, if the information leads to a recovery of tax that would have otherwise been lost. All payments are at the discretion of the Comptroller. Iras will ensure that the identities of informants are kept confidential.

Court documents did not reveal details about her mental condition.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew had earlier said: “She entrusted the accused with the monies in the said accounts for the accused to manage her investments in transactions that were authorised by her, make bill payments for her family and make monthly fund transfers to Tze Kaan for his living expenses.  “The accused was not authorised to make any other transaction with the victim’s bank accounts... for any other purpose.” But between March 2, 2015 and Jan 22, 2016, Tan made 11 unauthorised fund transfers from one of the accounts totalling more than $260,000. Court documents did not state how Tan’s offences came to light but Ms Pang made a police report in February 2016. More than $23,000 was later seized from Tan’s bank account. In addition, he has made $157,500 in restitution. UOB had said in an earlier statement that it does not tolerate any of its employees breaching its Code of Conduct. For criminal breach of trust, Tan could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.  "

Her former husband, who has been convicted of domestic violence charges in Jakarta but has yet to start his jail term, had challenged her move. He argued the case should not be heard in Singapore, claiming she had ""faked"" the divorce papers. But the apex court, in a written judgment on Wednesday, found the woman had shown substantial ground for the case to proceed. It is the first Court of Appeal decision involving provisions introduced to the Women's Charter in 2011, in which a regime is provided for a divorced spouse to get financial relief after obtaining a divorce in a foreign country. The court held that it was not necessary for an applicant to show that Singapore is the more appropriate forum. Neither is an applicant required to exhaust all available remedies in the foreign jurisdiction before applying to the Singapore courts. The couple are Indonesian citizens who married in 1995 and have three children, aged 22, 18 and 10. All are Singapore permanent residents. In 2012, the wife filed criminal charges against the husband for abusing her and their children. He was sentenced to 31/2 years' jail and fined 100 million rupiah (S$9,700) in 2013. The jail term was raised to 4½ years on his appeal to the West Jakarta High Court in 2014. Instead of serving his sentence, he remained in Singapore, contending that he had been convicted on ""hoax"" charges. The wife was granted a divorce in 2013 by the West Jakarta District Court, as well as sole custody of the children and an order for child maintenance. In October 2016, she applied for leave, or permission, to start proceedings in Singapore seeking division of the property she jointly owned with her former husband. Under the regime, applicants must first obtain leave from the court before they can move to the next stage for the court to hear the substantive application for financial relief. The woman's leave application was dismissed by a district judge on the ground that she should have applied to the Indonesian courts for financial relief before doing so in Singapore. She appealed to the High Court, which reversed the district judge's decision. Her former husband then appealed to the Court of Appeal. In its judgment dismissing the appeal, the apex court said the woman has met the requirements to be granted leave: There was a valid foreign divorce, the Singapore courts have jurisdiction to grant relief and she has shown ""substantial ground"" for the application. The court rejected the former husband's claims that the divorce was ""fake"" and the Singapore courts have no jurisdiction because he has been ""habitually resident"" in Singapore for fewer than three years. As for what constitutes ""substantial ground"", the court said an applicant only needed to show that, until proven otherwise, it would be appropriate for a Singapore court to grant relief. The court said the woman has shown this, given the fact that the property is in Singapore and the parties' connections to Singapore as permanent residents. It also called for changes to the procedure, to allow for leave applications to be heard ex parte, that is, without requiring the other side to be present. The court observed that the current regime is ""less than satisfactory"" because it requires the court to hear two rounds of arguments which add to costs and time spent. "

Lucy Teo, 49, was accused of conspiring with Sharon Loo Wai Woon, 28, to corruptly obtain $1,500 from Fenny Tey Hui Nee, 24, to speed up her PR application. Teo and Loo are Singaporeans. The Straits Times understands that they are mother and daughter, and that Loo, who worked at an immigration consultancy firm, had allegedly introduced the Malaysian to her mother. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a joint statement that all three women were charged yesterday over their alleged offences, which took place in 2017 and last year. Teo and Loo face two charges each for allegedly receiving the bribe and could face a maximum punishment of five years' jail and a $100,000 fine. Teo also faces 20 counts of unauthorised access into ICA's Central Identification and Registration Information System. She had allegedly entered the system 20 times - 11 times to retrieve Tey's PR application status records, thrice to access a man's passport number records, and six times to access another woman's PR application status records. Teo could face a fine of up to $5,000 or be jailed for up to two years, or both, if found guilty. Tey faces two counts of corruptly giving the bribe to Teo as an inducement to expedite her PR application. This offence is punishable with up to five years' jail and a $100,000 fine. In response to queries, ICA said it takes a serious view of errant officers. It reported Teo to the police after the case was detected through its internal checks and investigations. Teo has been interdicted from service since Dec 19 last year. CPIB and SPF said: ""The police will deal severely with public officers who mishandle any government systems and the data therein, including charging them in court.'' They added: ""Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. It is a serious offence to accept or obtain bribes from another individual or entity."" "

Vincent Peter, 51, pleaded guilty yesterday to 12 counts of dealing with the benefits of criminal activities. He was the sixth person linked to the scam to be convicted.

According to a statement from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Ho was taken into custody by the Singapore Police Force on Sept 26, and is being investigated for various alleged offences committed under Singapore law. According to the DOJ, between October 2017 and February 2018, following the surge in value and popularity of cryptocurrencies, Ho ""ran a large-scale cryptocurrency mining operation, propelled predominantly, if not exclusively, through fraud and identity theft"". The indictment describes Ho's activity as a ""sophisticated fraud scheme"". ""The essence of the scheme and artifice to defraud was to use stolen personal and financial information to open accounts in the names of others, without authorisation, in order to obtain things of value, including computing and data storage services,"" it says. In this way, Ho generated cryptocurrency units which he then sold and exchanged for regular currency. He allegedly used stolen identity and credit card information of a prominent California video-game developer to open cloud computing accounts at multiple American cloud service providers, which he used to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. He created a ""web of phony e-mail accounts and used social engineering techniques to trick cloud computing providers to approve heightened account privileges, increased computer processing power and storage, and deferred billing"", the DOJ said. Ho used the fraudulently obtained computing power to mine cryptocurrency - in which ""miners"" essentially compete to verify blockchain transactions and receive an amount of cryptocurrency in return, the DOJ said. ""In the few months his scheme remained active, Ho consumed more than US$5 million (S$6.9 million) in unpaid cloud computing services with his mining operation and, for a brief period, was one of Amazon Web Services (AWS) largest consumers of data usage by volume,"" the DOJ said. ""Some of the bills were paid by the California game developer's financial staff before the fraud was detected,"" the department added. Ho apparently also used the identities of a Texas resident and the founder of a tech company in India, and in addition to AWS, opened cloud services accounts with Google Cloud Services, which he similarly used as part of his cryptocurrency mining operation. Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, and access device fraud by up to 10 years. ""Aggravated identity theft"" is punishable by a mandatory two years in prison to run consecutive to any other sentences imposed in the case. The DOJ said the case is being investigated by the FBI Seattle Office's Cyber Crime Unit, with assistance from the Singapore Police Force - Technology Crime Investigation Branch, the Attorney General's Chambers of Singapore, the US DOJ's Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs, and the FBI Legal Attache Office. When contacted about the case, the Singapore Police Force confirmed that a 29-year-old man has been arrested and charged for an offence under the Computer Misuse Act, and that they are investigating the matter.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights activist Tan Seng Kee, better known as Roy Tan, said yesterday that his lawyer M. Ravi from Carson Law Chambers had attended a pre-trial conference on Tuesday. Dr Tan, a retired general practitioner who filed the latest challenge against the law last month, said hearings for his case and two other similar cases have been scheduled for Nov 13, 15, 18, 20, 21 and 22. The dates are subject to change at the judge's discretion. The two other challenges were filed last year by disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming, then 43, also known by his stage name DJ Big Kid, and Mr Bryan Choong, then 41, former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga. Section 377A criminalises acts of ""gross indecency"" between men, and carries a two-year jail term. The cases argue that Section 377A is inconsistent with various articles of the Singapore Constitution. The Attorney-General is listed as the defendant in all cases. They will be heard in the presence of all the lawyers arguing for their respective clients on those dates, Dr Tan said in a statement. ""The court may ask questions directed at the lawyers of the other cases while they are all in the courtroom at the same time."" He looks forward to having a good hearing and is hoping to have Section 377A finally struck down with the ""novel arguments"" conceived by his lawyer. In court documents seen earlier by The Straits Times, Dr Tan had said Section 377A is inconsistent with Articles 9, 12 and 14 of the Constitution, which guarantee the rights to life and liberty, equal protection under the law and free speech and expression. Dr Tan said in a statement on Sept 25 that the challenge is based on ""novel arguments"". For example, the public prosecutor has discretion on whether or not to prosecute an accused person under Section 377A, and the Government has said the law will not be enforced against acts done in private, Dr Tan said. He added that this is incongruous with Section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires the police to unconditionally investigate all complaints of suspected arrestable offences.

Lee Cheng Yan told District Judge Ng Peng Hong: ""I did not touch the car that day at all."" The 35-year-old Singaporean had been disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles from July 2017 till April last year over earlier traffic offences. But before the end of the driving ban, he bought the seven-year-old Maserati for $175,000 on Nov 9, 2017. He claimed he never saw the car before he bought it and never drove it, not even for a test drive. The Maserati was not valuable to him as it was ""an old car"", he told the court. Lee said that about two hours before the accident, he had given the car keys to a man known only as ""Kelvin"", whom he had known for about five months. He lent the Maserati ""reluctantly"" to Kelvin, whom he did not know ""that well"", the court heard. Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy questioned the existence of Kelvin and told Lee: ""You are obviously lying."" The accused, however, insisted he was telling the truth. Lee also said Kelvin was wearing a white top and checked shorts on the day of the accident. When the DPP pointed out that he was wearing a similar-looking outfit, Lee said Kelvin's top was ""pure white"", while his had ""luminous"" parts. Lee had told the authorities Kelvin was ""1.8 metres tall , fair and skinny"". When he was asked by the DPP if the description fits himself as well, Lee replied ""yes"" but stressed they have different faces. The court heard that neither Kelvin's surname nor address was given by Lee to the investigation officer. The only personal detail he gave was Kelvin's mobile phone number. It was not stated in court where Kelvin is now and he will not be testifying in court. Lee is claiming trial to 10 charges related to the accident, which happened around 9.20pm on Nov 17, 2017. The accused told Judge Ng that after handing Kelvin the car keys, he went for dinner before taking a taxi to meet his friend, marketing executive Jeff Chan. Lee said he arrived at Mr Chan's Kallang Bahru flat around 9pm and later received a call from another friend about an online video showing his car being involved in a hit-and-run accident. After watching the video, he said Mr Chan told him to contact the police. He also said Mr Chan told him to change his T-shirt to ""avoid unnecessary misunderstandings"" and handed him one to wear. Lee put it on and threw away his own T-shirt. Last week, Mr Chan told the court a different account, stating that Lee was the one who had asked to borrow a T-shirt. The police arrived at Mr Chan's home around 2am on Nov 18, 2017, and arrested Lee, who was charged in court later that day. Lee is out on $60,000 bail and the case has been adjourned to Dec 4. If convicted of causing grievous hurt to the policeman, he can be jailed for up to 15 years and be fined or caned. "

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights activist Tan Seng Kee, a retired general practitioner better known as Roy Tan, said on Wednesday (Oct 9) that his lawyer M. Ravi from Carson Law Chambers had attended a pre-trial conference on Tuesday. Dr Tan, 61, who filed the latest challenge against the law in September, said his case and two other similar cases have been scheduled to be heard on Nov 13, 15, 18, 20, 21 and 22. The two other challenges were filed last year by disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming, then 43, also known by his stage name DJ Big Kid, and Mr Bryan Choong, then 41, who is the former executive director of the LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga. All three cases argue that Section 377A is inconsistent with various articles of the Singapore Constitution. The Attorney-General has been listed as the defendant in all of the cases. Section 377A criminalises acts of ""gross indecency"" between men, and the offence carries up to a two-year jail term. All three cases will be heard in the presence of all the lawyers arguing for their respective plaintiffs on each of the dates, Dr Tan said in a statement sent to the media. ""The court may ask questions directed at the lawyers of the other cases while they are all in the courtroom at the same time."" He added that he looks forward to having a good hearing and is hoping to have Section 377A finally struck down with the novel arguments conceived of by his lawyer. In court documents seen earlier by The Straits Times, Dr Tan had said that Section 377A is inconsistent with Article 9 of the Constitution, which states that no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law. He also said that Section 377A is inconsistent with Article 12, which states that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to its equal protection, and Article 14, which states that every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression. Dr Tan said in a statement on Sept 25 that the challenge is based on ""novel arguments"". For example, the public prosecutor has discretion on whether or not to prosecute an accused person under Section 377A, and the Government has said that the law will not be enforced against acts done in private, Dr Tan said. He added that this is incongruous with Section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires the police to unconditionally investigate all complaints of suspected arrestable offences. ""This subjects gay men to the potential distress of an investigation into private conduct, where they have a legitimate expectation that the state will decline to prosecute,"" Dr Tan said in his statement.

The first of its kind to be built, the Home Team Joint Facility (HTJF) in Kallang Fire Station operates as a command and staging area during such operations. The fire station's location next to the Singapore Sports Hub and the city makes it an ideal site to house the facility, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam during the official opening of the fire station on Wednesday (Oct 9). ""It is a good platform for even greater collaborations within the home team agencies,"" said Mr Shanmugam. The HTJF is located on an upper floor in the fire station, and includes a main command room where personnel from the police, SCDF and other agencies will work together. SCDF's director of operations, Assistant Commissioner Daniel Seet, said the purpose-built facility would allow the agencies to quickly set up their command capabilities - unlike in the past where agencies must first find a suitable site for their operations. HTJF would be available to the police and SCDF during major events like the Formula 1 races and National Day as well as during security incidents, said AC Seet. ""This allows us to come together and think more about how we can do joint operations better, how to synergise our work better,"" he said. To accommodate such joint operations, the Kallang Fire Station has a total floor area of 14,000 sq m for housing a large number of emergency vehicles that can be quickly deployed. The fire station also houses vehicles such as the Pumper Firefighting Machine, an unmanned firefighting device, and will house the SCDF's first High Level Articulated Appliance, a machine that can be extended to reach the top of a 30-storey building. During the launch of the fire station on Wednesday, Mr Shanmugam also announced a new career track for uniformed officers known as the Ops-Tech track. These officers will receive specialist training and will be based in the SCDF and Singapore Police Force where they will integrate technology into the agencies' everyday operations. SCDF's Deputy Commissioner (Future Technology and Public Safety) Teong How Hwa said the officers will serve as a bridge between agencies like the SCDF, and the upcoming Home Team Science and Technology Agency. ""The future looks very exciting for them, because ops-tech officers can translate frontier technology into front-line operations."" "

Cleaning supervisor Mohamed Fazulla Mohamed Khan refused to surrender and wrongfully confined the 23-year-old woman in a bathroom of the Pasir Ris flat from around 3.30pm on March 21, 2016. He finally released her about 1½ hours later and surrendered himself at around 7.20pm that day. Fazulla, 36, who has earlier drug convictions, was sentenced on Wednesday (Oct 9) to five years' corrective training (CT) with three strokes of the cane. CT is a penalty meted out to repeat offenders and they are not eligible for the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. Fazulla had pleaded guilty earlier this year to nine charges for offences including theft, criminal intimidation and drug consumption. On March 16, 2016, he went to a watch shop in Thomson Road and spotted a Rolex Datejust watch worth $3,300 that was on display. While a sales assistant was attending to another customer, Fazulla slipped the watch into his pocket and walked away without paying for it. The store owner later found the watch missing and alerted the police. Following an investigation, police decided to ambush Fazulla at a Pasir Ris block five days later, where he was spotted at a staircase landing at around 3pm. He fled when he spotted the police and barged into the woman's flat on the fourth storey, as the main gate was unlocked. He took a knife with a 12.5cm-long blade from the kitchen and knocked on the bathroom door. The woman opened it and was shocked to see Fazulla with the weapon. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sheryl Yeo said: ""The victim then tried to close the toilet door but the accused managed to barge into the toilet."" Fazulla stopped the woman, who was fearful for her life but stayed quiet, from leaving the toilet. Police officers who had entered the flat asked Fazulla to release the woman. He refused and said that he would give himself up in two days' time. He released the woman at around 5pm but still did not want to surrender, telling officers that he would stab himself. The woman was not injured, the court heard. About 30 minutes later, officers from the Crisis Negotiation Unit were deployed to the scene and the Singapore Civil Defence Force set up an airbag on the ground floor. He finally surrendered and was taken to Bedok Police Division. Police searched Fazulla's flat on March 28, 2016, and found the Rolex watch that he had stolen. He was released on bail but instead of lying low, he went on to commit multiple counts of theft. Between August 2016 and December last year, he went to three different shops islandwide to steal items including a $3,350 Chanel bag and wallet worth $1,280. He also stole a cash card from a taxi driver in October last year. Fazulla is represented by lawyers Patrick Fernandez and Cheryl Tan. In their mitigation plea, they said their client suffers from antisocial personality disorder, ""making him lack impulse control, commit offences without considering the consequences, as well as disregard others' well-being"". The lawyers added that Fazulla lacked the ability to exercise self-control because of his mental illness. For each shoplifting charge, he could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

But Shafie Osman, 38, conspired to cheat the elderly victims by convincing them to hand over even more cash as ""fees"" to get their investments back. As part of the ruse, they were shown forged documents purportedly issued by banks, the Supreme Court and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. As a result of the scam, 10 senior citizens were cheated of nearly $270,000 in total. Some of the victims were low-income workers, earning less than $2,000 a month, and included a cleaner and a machine operator. Yesterday, Shafie was sentenced to four years' jail after he pleaded guilty to six cheating charges involving more than $240,000. Another three charges related to the remaining amount were considered during sentencing. Two of his accomplices - Annie Sahlawaty Mohd Salleh, 46, and Nur Khairunnisa Mohd Ridzwan, 32 - were dealt with in court earlier. The case involving a third alleged accomplice - Noorfauziah Yusof, 40 - is still pending. Deputy Public Prosecutor Eric Hu said that Shafie and the three women conspired between April and August 2015 to cheat their victims. The senior citizens had previously invested in companies, including one called Desa Amanah, but failed to receive dividends due to them or have their invested monies returned. No other details of the companies were mentioned in court documents. The DPP added that Shafie and Noorfauziah used to work for Desa Amanah. Thus, they had access to information about the victims' previous investments. DPP Hu told District Judge Samuel Chua: ""Consequently, they were able to equip the team with information which helped them to deceive the victims. ""Having dealt with the victims, they were able to tell the rest of the team how much each victim could pay and whether the victim was easy to deceive."" Court documents stated that the pair then arranged for the senior citizens to meet their other accomplices, on the pretext that the victims would be able to recover the monies they had lost through their earlier investments. The accomplices would then pretend to be a lawyer or a court officer before presenting the forged documents to the victims. Each victim handed over between $6,000 and $114,008 to the scammers. The senior citizens alerted the police when they did not receive any of the money promised. The court heard that Shafie received up to 30 per cent of the ill-gotten gains. The scammers have made no restitution to the victims. "

A district court heard that A. Sujendran had been riding his e-scooter at a speed of about 28kmh. According to the Active Mobility Regulations 2018, the maximum speed for personal mobility devices cannot exceed 25kmh under all circumstances. His e-scooter was also more than 6kg heavier than the permitted 20kg weight limit for such devices. The 28-year-old Singaporean, who also worked as a part-time pump attendant, was sentenced yesterday to six weeks in jail for causing grievous hurt to bus captain Mohamed Salam Kadir by riding the e-scooter in a rash manner. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kong Kuek Foo said Sujendran was riding the device home from work at 3.15am on May 6 last year when he reached the ground floor of Block 293 Yishun Street 22. He did not reduce his speed even though there were pedestrians in the area, the court heard. The DPP told District Judge John Ng: ""When the accused was near the lift landing area, he saw the victim walking out from the ground-floor staircase landing... The accused applied the brakes (of) the e-scooter, but nonetheless collided into the victim from the back."" Mr Salam, 53, fell to the ground when the device hit his right leg, and he was unable to stand because of the pain. Sujendran and several passers-by stopped to check on Mr Salam, who was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in an ambulance. He was later found to have a possible fracture to his right shin bone and was given 47 days of hospitalisation leave. He also incurred medical expenses totalling more than $160. DPP Kong said Mr Salam has since made a complete recovery. Sujendran, who was unrepresented, pleaded for ""one last chance"" yesterday. He told the judge that he has a family to support and ""will not be riding e-scooters any more"". He is now out on bail of $5,000 and will surrender himself at the State Courts on Nov 11 to begin serving his sentence. For causing grievous hurt by riding the e-scooter in a rash manner, he could have been jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000. "

A district court heard that A. Sujendran had been riding his e-scooter at a speed of about 28kmh. According to Active Mobility Regulations 2018, the maximum speed for personal mobility devices cannot exceed 25kmh under all circumstances. His e-scooter was also more than 6kg heavier than the permitted 20kg weight limit of such devices. The 28-year-old Singaporean, who also worked as a part-time pump attendant, was sentenced on Tuesday (Oct 8) to six weeks' jail for causing grievous hurt to bus captain Mohamed Salam Kadir by riding the e-scooter in a rash manner. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kong Kuek Foo said Sujendran was riding the device to his home from work at around 3.15am on May 6 last year when he reached the ground floor of Block 293, Yishun Street 22. He did not reduce his speed even though there were pedestrians in the area, the court heard. The DPP told District Judge John Ng: ""When the accused was near the lift landing area, he saw the victim walking out from the ground floor staircase landing... The accused applied the brakes (of) the e-scooter but nonetheless collided into the victim from the back."" Mr Salam, 53, fell to the ground when the device hit his right leg and was unable to stand because of the pain. Sujendran and several passers-by stopped to check on Mr Salam, who was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in an ambulance. He was later found to have a possible fracture to his right shin bone and was given 47 days of hospitalisation leave. He also incurred medical expenses totalling more than $160. DPP Kong said Mr Salam has since made a complete recovery. Sujendran, who was unrepresented, pleaded for ""one last chance"" on Tuesday. He told Judge Ng that he has a family to support and ""will not be riding e-scooters any more"". He is now out on bail of $5,000 and will surrender himself at the State Courts on Nov 11 to begin serving his sentence. For causing grievous hurt by riding the e-scooter in a rash manner, he could have been jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000. "

Seven-month-old Yuri Chua Le En, who slept in a bed in her own room, ended up in the same spot again - this time with fatal consequences. On Jan 15 this year at around 7am, her father went to check on her and found her unresponsive. The police were alerted and paramedics who came to the family's Jurong East flat pronounced the baby dead at the scene. Her parents were not named in court documents. A forensic pathologist later certified her death to be consistent with suffocation. Following an inquiry last Friday, State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam found Yuri's death to be an ""unfortunate misadventure"". She said that according to the pathologist, a developmentally normal seven-month-old baby can usually roll around on a bed, but is unable to crawl or climb effectively. As a result, when the baby accidentally rolls into a gap, it is unlikely that he or she can climb out of it. The state coroner added that paediatricians and those involved in infant care regularly emphasise the ABCs of safe sleep for babies - ""alone, back and crib"". She explained: ""The infant should not sleep in the same bed as others, but not necessarily in a different room. There is always a risk of suffocation... when a larger person rolls over and the infant's airway becomes blocked.""

When they arrived at his home, they spotted patrol cars in the vicinity. ""He didn't dare go home and asked to go back to my home again,"" Mr Chan told the court.

District Judge Jasvender Kaur yesterday allowed a stay of execution on the probation order, pending the outcome of the prosecution's appeal. Prosecutors are seeking to overturn the judge's decision to sentence Siow to 21 months' supervised probation, instead of their proposed sentence of six weeks' jail. Besides the probation, Siow was also ordered on Sept 25 to perform 150 hours of community service and attend an offence-specific treatment programme. His parents had to put up a $5,000 bond to ensure their son's good behaviour during the probation. In Siow's probation suitability report, the student admitted to committing similar acts since he enrolled in the National University of Singapore in 2016, but indicated he was unable to recall the number of times he did it. However, the judge rejected the prosecution's call for a jail sentence, saying Siow had a strong propensity to reform and had characterised his offences as ""minor intrusions"". Noting his academic results and the recommendation for probation, the judge said: ""I think there can be no doubt that there is extremely strong propensity for reform. ""He was 22 years old when he committed the offences... and the nature of the acts (is) relatively minor."" The decision prompted many to question the adequacy of the sentence and the relevance of academic results in sentencing him. Law Minister K. Shanmugam also weighed in on the topic, taking to social media to express his surprise at the sentence, while calling for netizens to avoid casting aspersions on the judge. In court yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Gail Wong said a stay of execution of the probation order would be in the interest of fairness and justice, maintaining that the offences committed by Siow were ""serious"" ones. However, Siow's lawyer Raphael Louis said the student should be allowed to continue with the rehabilitative process, noting that Siow needs help to change. ""The probation process is in place to help him, not to hinder the appeal process or stifle the prosecution's submissions,"" said Mr Louis. But DPP Wong said there would be a dilemma, after the appeal, if Siow has already served part of his probation. ""There's nothing to impede him from (seeking help) even if the stay of execution is granted,"" she said. In deciding to allow a stay of execution on the probation order, the judge said that even if the High Court agreed with her decision, all it would cost Siow is a delay in the start of his probation. On the other hand, if the High Court allows the appeal, then Siow would have ""undergone a programme that was not meant for him"", she said. <a href=""https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/preventing-sexual-offences-before-they-happen"" target=""_blank"">SEE FORUM</a> "

The 2016 event, called ""Civil Disobedience and Social Movements"", was meant for speakers, including Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, to share their knowledge and views, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam told the High Court. He argued that the event was not carried out to publicise a cause and, hence, did not constitute a public assembly that required a permit. Mr Thuraisingam also argued that the requirement for a permit under the Public Order Act was unconstitutional and invalid. Making it an offence for someone to organise a public assembly without a permit was a contravention of a citizen's right of assembly under the Constitution, he said. Justice Chua Lee Ming reserved judgment to consider these arguments and will give his decision at a later date. Wham, 39, had organised the event, held at an indoor venue on Nov 26, 2016, and invited all 7,600 of his followers on Facebook to attend. The event featured speeches by freelance journalist Kirsten Han, activist Seelan Palay and Mr Wong, who spoke via a video call. Four days before the event, Wham was told by the police that a permit was required for the event, but he did not apply for one. Police investigations started after the event, and a statement was recorded from Wham. However, he refused to sign the statement, saying he would do so only if he was given a copy. He later signed two other statements after being told he would get copies. He was charged with organising a public assembly without a permit and for refusing to sign his statement and, following a district court trial, was  Wham was  Under the Act, an assembly includes any gathering or meeting held for the purpose of publicising a cause. On Friday, Mr Thuraisingam said the speakers were merely sharing their thoughts and having academic discussions on issues relating to civil disobedience and democracy in social change. For instance, Mr Wong gave an account of his activism activities in Hong Kong but did not go on to say that people in Singapore should do the same, said Mr Thuraisingam. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan argued that the event clearly sought to publicise the cause of civil disobedience and social movements and how to reach this goal. He cited the speech that Wham gave at the event, in which the activist noted that the Singapore approach to activism was to ""have a picnic"" like the Pink Dot movement. In the speech, Wham said: ""We don't seem to like this very confrontational civil disobedience types of actions. So how do we get there, I think, this is the billion-dollar question."" "

But Ang Cheng Guan, 47, got embroiled in  He was convicted on Friday (Oct 4) after pleading guilty to six money laundering charges and another two of breaching a director's duty. Another 20 related charges will be taken into account during sentencing. The syndicate used nine shell companies to submit more than 8,000 fraudulent claims to SSG between April and October 2017. On Friday, the court heard that Ang was introduced to a Sim Soon Lee, 43, by a mutual friend some time in July 2017. Sim told Ang that he could not register a company as he was a bankrupt, and asked to borrow Ang's name to register companies, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordan Li. ""The accused agreed to Sim's request despite suspecting that Sim was going to use the companies to carry out illegal activities,"" said DPP Li. A few days after their meeting, Ang signed some documents without reading them. He then became the director and shareholder of several companies, a partner in a limited liability partnership and business owner of several sole-proprietorships. These entities were used by the syndicate to submit the fraudulent applications to the SSG. Ang also opened two bank accounts on Sim's instructions, and Sim would instruct him to encash cheques into the two accounts. For each trip to the bank, Ang was paid $3,000 to $5,000. While Ang did not know the source of income for the companies he ""owned"", he had suspected that the monies were obtained from ""illegal means"" since the day Sim approached him for his name, said DPP Li. ""Despite this, the accused continued to help Sim launder the criminal proceeds as he needed the money,"" said DPP Li. Ang left Singapore on Sept 26 that year for China. Some time later, his wife told him that the Singapore authorities were looking for him, and Ang decided to stay in China. He was deported to Singapore on Oct 7 last year and arrested on the same day. In mitigation, defence counsel Too Xing Ji said Ang had a low level of culpability, as he was only following instructions from Sim and did not know about the nature of the transactions . Ang, who was in jail previously for drug offences, had lost his job as a Grab driver and turned to his friends ""out of desperation"" as he had difficulties finding another job, said Mr Too. However, the prosecution sought a jail sentence of at least 8½ years and a five-year disqualification order as a director, citing factors such as the ""staggering sums"" involved. Ang will be sentenced on Oct 18. Sim's case will be dealt with in court at a later date. "

Chew Guan Mong, 45, pleaded guilty in August to 16 charges for various offences, including armed robbery, possession of methamphetamine, helping to keep ransom monies from a kidnapping plot, and splashing paint outside debtors' flats on behalf of loan sharks. Another 25 charges were considered during sentencing. Chew, who was first convicted in 1994 for armed robbery, returned to a life of crime after he was released from prison in 2016 following a 12-year term of corrective training. His lawyer, Mr Josephus Tan, told the court that Chew has ""newfound meanings to life"" after his wife gave birth to their son in August last year, while he was remanded in custody for his latest crime spree. Pleading for compassion, Mr Tan asked for not more than 13 years' preventive detention. However, District Judge Ng Peng Hong agreed with Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong, who submitted for 15 years' preventive detention. On the afternoon of Jan 5 last year, Chew drove a rented Toyota Camry along the Pan-Island Expressway towards Tuas. He swerved in a zigzag pattern between two lanes and as he approached the exit to Clementi Road, he sideswiped an SMRT bus. The car veered left and right several times before crashing to a stop near the road shoulder. No one was hurt in the collision. Chew, who has been banned from driving from 2004 till 2034 for previous offences, then abandoned the car and ran across the centre divider to the opposite side of the expressway. At the time, he was carrying a bag containing a sickle, a rusty long knife and a bottle of kerosene. As he neared the end of the slip road merging into Upper Bukit Timah Road, he ran up to a Mazda driven by a 40-year-old woman. Wielding the sickle, he opened the door on the driver's side and shouted at her to get out of the vehicle. Chew then drove to Woodlands Checkpoint in her car but entered a lane for motorcycles by mistake and was eventually stuck. Desperate to escape, he crashed through a traffic control barrier, causing damage amounting to more than $6,500. He brandished the sickle when officers stationed at the checkpoint approached the car but was eventually subdued. A small packet of methamphetamine, commonly known as Ice, was found on him. Separately, Chew also played a role in a kidnapping plot in which he roped in another man to collect $80,000 in ransom from the victim's father in 2017. The kidnapping victim was a 41-year-old man called Goh Chun Kiat who made plans to illegally flee from Singapore after he was arrested for cheating. After they each took a $1,000 cut from the ransom, Chew and his accomplice passed the remaining $78,000 to a third person. "

However, the policeman testified that he could not identify the driver of the Maserati as ""everything happened so fast"". Technician Tay Boon Chong, who also took the stand yesterday, told Judge Ng that he was in a nearby van with two other people when the incident took place. Mr Tay's age was not mentioned in court.

DPP Koh said that after the accident, Lee abandoned the Maserati in Willow Avenue, near Aljunied Road. He added that Lee then went to a friend's home and told the man that he ""ran away from the Traffic Police"". The court heard that Lee spoke to another friend over the phone soon after and made a similar confession. He is now out on bail of $60,000, and his trial will resume today.

The victim finally left the flat to meet her mother and lodge a police report.

After the rape, he told her not to go to the police as he was under investigation for the earlier rape. He also made her delete the text messages they exchanged. He called his mother to come over and the woman spoke to the victim before taking her home in a taxi. The teenager made a police report about a month later. "

They include voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the police officer, failing to stop after an accident and obstruction of justice. Lee, who owned the car at the time, is also facing 59 other charges related to matters such as  These charges will be dealt with at a later date. In his opening address on Thursday (Oct 3), Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh said Lee drove the car despite being disqualified due to earlier traffic offences. He also did not have the mandatory third-party risk insurance for the car at the time of the incident. The court heard that Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar Abd Kahar, 26, had stopped the white Maserati in Bedok Reservoir Road at about 9.20pm as Lee was not using his seat belt. DPP Koh said: “The victim parked his motorcycle in front of the Maserati before dismounting. The victim then approached the driver’s window to speak to the accused. The accused wound down his window.  “However, instead of complying, the accused fled the scene by suddenly reversing the Maserati before accelerating quickly forward while the victim was standing next to the driver-seat door.” He added that Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar’s uniform got caught in the driver-side door of the Maserati. The car, which was moving at between 79 and 84km, then dragged the policeman for more than 100 metres before he fell onto the road. The Maserati then sped off, the court heard.  Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar was taken to hospital to be treated for pain over his right knee, neck and lower back. He was later given more than 20 days of medical leave. The officer has been medically downgraded by the Home Team Medical Board due to his injuries. Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar, who took the stand on Thursday, told District Judge Ng Peng Hong that he still feels pain on his lower back when he carries heavy objects. He added that the injuries have affected his career and his promotion prospects. However, the policeman testified that he could not identify the driver of the Maserati as “everything happened so fast”. Technician Tay Boon Chong, who also took the stand on Thursday, told Judge Ng that he was in a nearby van with two other people when the incident took place. Mr Tay’s age was not mentioned in court. Two video clips taken from cameras in the van show Staff Sergeant Khairulanwar being dragged along the road before falling. One of the clips shows the officer lying on the road with passers-by rushing over to help him. But when cross-examined by one of Lee’s lawyers, Mr S. Balamurugan, Mr Tay told the court that he could not identify Lee, who was seated in the dock, as the driver. DPP Koh said that after the accident, Lee abandoned the Maserati in Willow Avenue near Aljunied Road. He added that Lee then went to a friend’s home and told the man that he “ran away from the Traffic Police”. The court heard that Lee spoke to another friend over the phone soon after and made a similar confession. He is now out on bail of $60,000 and his trial will resume on Friday. If convicted of causing grievous hurt to the policeman, he can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned. "

Another 25 charges were considered during sentencing. Chew, who was first convicted in 1994 for armed robbery, returned to a life of crime after he was released from prison in 2016 following a 12-year term of corrective training. His lawyer, Mr Josephus Tan, told the court on Thursday that Chew has ""newfound meanings to life"" after his wife gave birth to their son in August 2018, while he was remanded in custody for his latest crime spree. Pleading for compassion, Mr Tan asked for not more than 13 years' preventive detention. However, district judge Ng Peng Hong agreed with Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong, who submitted for 15 years' preventive detention. On the afternoon of Jan 5, 2018, Chew drove a rented Toyota Camry along Pan Island Expressway (PIE) towards Tuas. He swerved in a zig-zag pattern between two lanes and as he approached the exit to Clementi Road, he sideswiped an SMRT bus. The car veered several times before crashing to a stop near the road shoulder. No one was hurt in the collision. Chew, who has been banned from driving from 2004 till 2034 for previous offences, then abandoned the car and ran across the centre divider to the opposite side of the expressway. At the time, he was carrying a bag containing a sickle, a rusty long knife and a bottle of kerosene. As he neared the end of the slip road merging into Upper Bukit Timah Road, he ran up to a Mazda driven by a 40-year-old woman. Wielding the sickle, he opened the door on the driver's side and shouted at her to get out of the vehicle. Chew then drove to the Woodlands Checkpoint in her car but entered a lane for motorcycles by mistake and was eventually stuck. Desperate to escape, he crashed through a traffic control barrier, causing damage amounting to more than $6,500. He brandished the sickle when officers stationed at the checkpoint approached the car but was eventually subdued. After his arrest, police searched Chew and the car and found a small packet of methamphetamine, commonly known as Ice, on him. Separately, Chew also played a role in a kidnapping plot in which he roped in another man to collect $80,000 in ransom from the victim's father in 2017. The kidnapping victim was a 41-year-old man called Goh Chun Kiat who made plans to illegally flee from Singapore after he was arrested for cheating. After taking their $1,000 cut from the ransom, Chew and his accomplice passed the remaining $78,000 to a third person. "

He added: ""By driving with a person on the car's windscreen, the accused did not only endanger the life of the person clinging onto the vehicle, but also other road users since he drove with his vision of the road obscured."" Koh is now out on bail of $10,000 and was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on Oct 14 to begin serving his sentence. For performing a rash act that endangered a life, he could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $2,500. "

While his family members were away on holiday, Stanley Cheng Kim Han placed his head on the 23-year-old Myanmar national's right shoulder on Nov 28, 2016. The next day, he hugged the woman from behind and used the fingers of his left hand to touch her right breast over her clothes. On Aug 7, District Judge Edgar Foo found the 44-year-old father of two guilty of two molestation charges after a 10-day trial. In sentencing the Singaporean on Wednesday, Judge Foo said Cheng had abused his position when he was alone in his flat with the maid. The judge also said that there was ""an escalation"" in the offences and the woman was ""traumatised"" after Cheng molested her for the second time. Cheng's former lawyer, Mr T.M. Sinnadurai, was also discharged on Wednesday and he is now represented by Mr Gino Hardial Singh. Cheng, who has been employed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) for more than 20 years, intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence. He was offered bail of $20,000. The maid, who cannot be named due to a gag order, started working in Cheng's Bedok Reservoir flat on Sept 22, 2016. The court heard that this was the first time she had left her village to work overseas. Deputy Public Prosecutor Asoka Markandu had said in his submissions that Cheng, who was the maid's registered employer, had a habit of brushing against or touching the woman when he walked past. The DPP added that the nature of these contacts were ""brief and innocent"", such that the maid did not have any cause to be concerned. Cheng and the maid were left alone in the flat after his wife, two children and parents-in-law flew to China for their holiday at around 3am on Nov 27, 2016. He molested her inside a bedroom the next day by placing his head on her right shoulder. He struck again at around 5.40pm on Nov 29, 2016, when he hugged her from behind in the master bedroom toilet and touched her right breast. He later left the flat and that same day, she told her trainer at the maid agency about what had happened. A CAAS spokesman had earlier said the authority suspended Cheng after he was charged in court in July 2017. For each count of molestation, he could have been jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. "

Her younger sister, then four years old, was also ill-treated but a medical check-up showed that she had no gross external injuries.

Anita Damu, 51, is appealing against her jail term of two years and seven months for, among other things, pouring scalding hot water over her domestic worker and using a hot iron to hurt her. The issue of contention between the prosecution and the defence is whether the convicted woman experienced auditory hallucinations at the time of the offences. Yesterday, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon set aside the finding of a district judge who had earlier accepted reports by two psychiatrists that Anita had auditory hallucinations. The relevance and reliability of the psychiatric evidence were critically undermined by Anita's failure to give direct evidence by testifying in court, he said. ""In the absence of any direct evidence from the appellant, the district judge had no factual basis at all on which to make a finding as to the veracity of the appellant's assertions that she had in fact heard voices and acted upon them,"" said the Chief Justice. He said Anita should testify as it was incumbent on her to present the best evidence available to support her assertion. ""This is something that is uniquely within her personal knowledge, and thus the best evidence is that of the appellant herself,"" said the Chief Justice. He said the fair course to take would be to give Anita the choice to take the stand, although prosecutors argued the psychiatric evidence should be disregarded entirely for the appeal. In response, her lawyer Sarindar Singh told the court that she will do so. The case was adjourned for parties to work out how this was to be carried out. In September last year, Anita pleaded guilty to charges related to various acts of abuse against her maid. She splashed hot water on the victim because she ate a longan without permission. She also burned the maid's hands with an iron, claiming she was slow in her work. "

Yesterday, lawyer Gary Leonard Low told District Judge Eddy Tham that his client has major depressive disorder. The judge, however, replied that probation is given to adult offenders only in ""exceptional"" cases. He added that there were no such circumstances in Chan's case.

Ms Rasi did not have a mobile phone and was not allowed to speak to the neighbours.

When former insurance agent Fong Poh Kuen failed to obtain any information from the girl, he stalked her until she entered junior college in 2017. He also secretly snapped photographs of other girls and downloaded the images onto his laptop computer. For these and snapping upskirt pictures of a woman, Fong, 43, was sentenced on Tuesday (Oct 1) to three months' jail and a fine of $8,000. He had pleaded guilty to five offences under the Protection from Harassment Act and one count of insulting a woman's modesty. The girls and their schools cannot be named. A district court heard that Fong had created forms for an ""educational survey"" and would approach female students outside various secondary schools and JCs, asking the girls to fill them up. After the teenagers filled up the forms with information such as their names, contact numbers and home addresses, Fong would then collate their particulars on a spreadsheet. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran said the man used the surveys as a pretext to approach the girls that he was attracted to. ""On a number of occasions, he would follow these girls either before or after the girls had filled up survey forms and take a number of photographs of them."" The girls did not know they were being photographed. On Feb 13, 2017, Fong spotted the girl he had been stalking and started following the 17-year-old JC student for about 20 minutes. He also snapped 22 photographs of her. Later that year, he tailed her to an MRT station and asked her to fill up a survey form. The girl complied and penned in her personal details including her mobile phone number. Fong later sent her a text message which stated ""Happy Good Friday"". The girl stopped responding after finding out he was the one who had sent it. On Feb 6, 2017, Fong also snapped upskirt photographs of an unidentified woman at a bus stop in Marine Parade Road.

Police said in a statement on Tuesday that the women, aged between 36 and 52, were agents of Genneva, a gold investment company that sold gold bars under a buyback scheme between 2008 and 2012. Under the scheme, Genneva sold gold bars to customers and promised returns of up to 36 per cent on customers' investments with the company over a contract period. Customers were subsequently told to deposit the gold bars with the company for inspection purposes and were promised an equivalent quantity of gold after three working days. Genneva is believed to have collected around 3,500kg of gold from its customers, and the four agents pawned 31kg of the gold collected from customers. They eventually redeemed the gold by allegedly deceiving the pawnshops that they lost the pawn tickets. The women were charged in court with cheating, dishonestly inducing delivery of property and money laundering offences. If found guilty of cheating, they can be fined and jailed for up to 10 years. If convicted of money laundering, they can be fined up to $500,000, jailed for up to 10 years, or both. Genneva was at the centre of a controversial operation around the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Andrew Low also told District Judge Brenda Tan that Muhammad Fuad Kamroden had committed three of the four latest offences while he was out on bail. Defence lawyer Leslie Gregory Robert told the court his client was sorry and understood that ""he has a problem"". Fuad has been seeking help for anger management issues since last year. He is out on bail of $15,000 and is set to be sentenced on Oct 31. In July, the 35-year-old Singaporean private-hire car driver pleaded guilty to one count each of causing grievous hurt to a lorry driver and causing hurt to an elderly cabby. He had also admitted to using criminal force on two other men. The recalcitrant offender, who was sentenced to seven weeks' jail in May 2016 for road rage, ran afoul of the law again when he attacked Mr Pek Lian Hui just three months after being released from jail. The court heard that Mr Pek, 52, was driving his lorry in a National University of Singapore carpark on Aug 12, 2016. Fuad, who was driving behind the lorry, felt that the older man was moving too slowly and decided to overtake him. As he was passing the lorry, he made an obscene hand gesture at Mr Pek. Then he stopped in front of the lorry. Mr Pek alighted, walked over to Fuad's car and knocked on the window. Fuad got out and punched the older man several times on his face, head and abdomen. Mr Pek subsequently called the police and was taken to National University Hospital, where he was found to have suffered injuries including multiple facial fractures. Fuad was arrested soon after and was out on bail when he was involved in a second road rage incident, on Dec 2, 2017. He pushed taxi driver Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed Sharif, 46, causing the older man to lose his balance. In another incident on May 6 last year, Fuad was walking along a corridor in VivoCity mall when Mr Ye Zhaojin, 37, accidentally bumped into his right shoulder. Enraged, Fuad confronted Mr Ye before repeatedly shoving him. Fuad attacked his fourth victim, cabby Tio Seng Sing, 71, on Feb 26 this year. He was riding a motorcycle when he suddenly cut into the path of the older man's vehicle in Selegie Road.

The Bangladeshi fled empty-handed but left behind his ""bomb belt"" during the failed robbery attempt on July 28 last year. It prompted officers from the Bomb and Explosive Branch to be sent to scene, and exits at the nearby Boon Lay MRT station were also shut for more than two hours as experts inspected the device. They were reopened after police found the ""bomb belt"" did not contain any explosives, a district court heard on Monday (Sept 30). Razan, 30, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years' jail with 18 strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to one count each of attempted armed robbery as well as exhibiting the fake gun and ""bomb belt"" when committing the offence. He also admitted to overstaying in Singapore for more than 200 days, being in possession of a forged work permit and using a second bogus work permit to seek illegal employment here. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua said Razan hatched his robbery plan last year. She added: ""The accused decided to disguise himself with a turban as he had observed that his Sikh roommate's face was partially covered when he wore his turban. He also thought that he could throw the police off his trail by disguising himself as a member of a different ethnic group."" On July 27 last year, he made the fake gun and ""bomb belt"" by using such items as a metal pipe and components from a battery-operated toy dog. The next day, he went to the pawnshop around 4.30pm. The outlet had about $72,000 in cash and more than $15 million worth of jewellery. The court heard that he showed its employees the fake bomb before ordering them to place money and jewellery inside his bag. But none of the workers obeyed his orders. Instead, they tried to get away from him. Realising his plan was falling apart, Razan removed the fake bomb belt from his waist, placed it on a counter and fled. The outlet's branch manager, thinking the ""bomb belt"" was real, grabbed it and flung it towards an open space outside the shop before calling the police. Officers found the device was a fake. Meanwhile, Razan changed his clothes and shaved off his facial hair to alter his appearance. To shake off the police, he also took four different buses and a taxi to get away. He was arrested at Sultan Mosque on Aug 1 last year after a five-day islandwide manhunt.

Defence lawyer Leslie Gregory Robert told the court that his client is sorry and understands that ""he has a problem"". Fuad, a Singaporean, has been seeking help for anger management issues since last year. He is now out on bail of $15,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Oct 31. In July, the 35-year-old private-hire car driver pleaded guilty to one count each of causing grievous hurt to a lorry driver and causing hurt to an elderly cabby. He had also admitted to using criminal force on two other men. The recalcitrant offender, who was  The court heard that Mr Pek, 52 was driving his lorry at a National University of Singapore carpark on Aug 12, 2016, when Fuad felt that he was moving too slowly. He overtook Mr Pek's vehicle and flashed him an obscene hand gesture as he passed before stopping in front of the lorry. Mr Pek alighted, walked over to Fuad's car and knocked on the driver's seat window. Fuad got out of his car and punched the older man several times on his face, head and stomach. Mr Pek managed to disengage himself but when he stated that he would alert the police, Fuad rained more blows on him before driving away. Mr Pek called the police and was taken to the National University Hospital where he was found with injuries, including multiple facial fractures. Fuad was arrested soon after and was out on bail when he was caught in a second road rage incident on Dec 2, 2017. He pushed taxi driver Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed Sharif, 46, causing the older man to lose his balance. DPP Bjorn Tan had earlier said that this incident occurred at a Clarke Quay taxi stand, after the left side mirror of Fuad's car struck the right side mirror of Mr Iqbal's vehicle. In another incident on May 6 last year, Fuad was walking along a corridor in Vivocity shopping mall when Mr Ye Zhaojin, 37, accidentally bumped into his right shoulder. Enraged, Fuad confronted Mr Ye before repeatedly shoving him. When an off-duty policeman stepped in, Fuad raised his voice at the officer and said it was none of his business. Fuad attacked his fourth victim, taxi driver Tio Seng Sing, 71, after his motorcycle suddenly cut into the older man's vehicle along Selegie Road on Feb 26 this year. He flashed an obscene hand gesture at Mr Tio and according to an eyewitness, punched the senior citizen's face when approached. For causing grievous hurt, Fuad can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. "

Anita Damu, 51, is appealing against  The issue in contention between the prosecution and the defence is whether the convicted woman experienced auditory hallucinations at the time of the offences. On Monday (Sept 30), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon set aside the finding of a district judge who had accepted reports by two psychiatrists that Anita had auditory hallucinations. The relevance and reliability of the psychiatric evidence was critically undermined by Anita's failure to give direct evidence by testifying in court. ""In the absence of any direct evidence from the appellant, the district judge had no factual basis at all on which to make a finding as to the veracity of the appellant's assertions that she had in fact heard voices and acted upon them,"" said the Chief Justice. He said Anita should testify as it was incumbent on her to present the best evidence available to support her assertion. ""This is something that is uniquely within her personal knowledge, and thus the best evidence is that of the appellant herself,"" said Chief Justice Menon. He said the fair course to take would be to give Anita the choice to take the stand, although prosecutors had argued that the psychiatric evidence should be disregarded entirely for the appeal. In response, her lawyer, Mr Sarindar Singh, told the court that she will do so. The case was adjourned for parties to work out the specifics of how this was to be carried out. In September last year, Anita pleaded guilty to charges for various acts of abuse against her domestic worker. She splashed hot water on the victim because the maid ate a longan fruit without her permission. She also burned the victim's hands with an iron, claiming that she was slow in her work. She also poked the victim with a bamboo pole for making mistakes. In mitigation, Anita asserted that she was suffering from major depressive disorder with features of auditory hallucinations, which made her commit the offences. The prosecution disputed this. At the end of a hearing to determine this issue, the district judge accepted the psychiatrists' diagnoses. Anita was sentenced to a jail term of two years and seven months and ordered to pay compensation of $8,000. The prosecution and Anita both appealed against the sentence and the compensation order. "

It was only after he stopped his vehicle that he realised the sound had come from his side mirror breaking, said Teo Seng Tiong, 58. Teo, who took the stand on Thursday on the third day of his trial, said this was because it happened ""too suddenly"". When grilled by Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong on why he was able to tell that the honking sound came from the right, but could not tell where the crushing sound came from, Teo said: ""At that point in time, I wasn't able to differentiate."" He added that he did not feel any sensation in the lorry from the mirror breaking. Teo, who owns a fish farm, was involved in an incident with cyclist Eric Cheung Hoyu, 35, at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Pasir Ris Rise on Dec 22 last year. In the video of the incident, which has garnered over three million views to date, Mr Cheung is seen using his hand to hit the left side mirror of Teo's lorry. The lorry then suddenly swerves to the left in the direction of Mr Cheung, who falls off his bicycle and onto the grass verge by the side of the road. Both men were arrested within three days of the incident. In April, Mr Cheung was fined $2,800 for committing mischief and causing obstruction by riding his bicycle in the middle of the lane instead of the leftmost side. Teo is contesting his two charges - one for acting rashly as to cause hurt to Mr Cheung, and the other for failing to make a police report within 24 hours of the accident. If convicted of the first charge, he could be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. For the second charge, he could be jailed for up to three months or fined up to $1,000 as a first-time offender. Teo told the court that he swerved left in the direction of Mr Cheung, as he had heard the taxi sound its horn at him, and then the sound of ""something breaking"". Thinking he had hit the taxi, he ""instinctively swerved a little"", said Teo, who has been driving for more than 30 years. When he stopped his lorry, the taxi did not stop. Teo said he then felt something was amiss and realised he had not hit the taxi. ""I paused a little, and realised that my mirror was damaged. So I alighted to take a look,"" he added. When he got out of his vehicle, Teo said Mr Cheung shouted a vulgarity at him and kept referring to his bicycle. Teo said he then asked Mr Cheung what had happened to his side mirror. ""I did not knock into him, so I had no idea why the mirror was damaged,"" he added. He said he was worried that Mr Cheung would ask him to compensate for the damage to the bicycle. When asked by DPP Choong if he was unhappy that his side mirror was broken, he replied: ""Why would I be unhappy with the mirror? It costs only $15, I just took it as my misfortune. I just wanted to ask (Mr Cheung) why the mirror was broken."" "

The 28-year-old victim, who had identified herself openly on Facebook and in an interview with The New Paper, had said she was disappointed with the verdict as she had hoped the perpetrator would be given jail time instead.

His academic results show that he has the ""potential to excel in life"", said the judge. The case has seen strong reactions online, with many saying that the sentence was inadequate and querying why Siow's academic results were relevant to it. An online petition rallying people to stand against the purported favouritism towards ""educated sex offenders"" had gathered more than 29,000 signatures as at 10pm last night on the change.org website. However, lawyers noted that many factors would be taken into account during sentencing, and not just a person's educational qualifications.

Abraham Rock, 36, ""carried out online research on which insurance policies gave the highest payouts upon the death of the insured and the requisite documents for making a claim"", according to court documents. He bought insurance policies and travel insurance for his mother Talat Farman, 54, between July 2017 and April last year. They then went to Pakistan in June last year, where he obtained forged documents falsely stating that she was killed in a traffic accident there. A district court heard that he made claims totalling more than $3.7 million. Out of this amount, the CPF Board and NTUC Income paid out around $130,000 in total. Abraham was sentenced yesterday to three years and 10 months in jail after he pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating. He also admitted to one count each of giving false information to a public servant and fabricating false evidence to be used in a judicial proceeding. District Judge Christopher Tan sentenced Talat, 54, to 13 months in jail after she pleaded guilty to two cheating charges. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Chin said that Abraham was facing financial difficulties in 2017 when he came up with the ruse. He ""kept a spreadsheet detailing Talat's insurance policies and the potential payouts to be obtained from Talat's purported death"", added the DPP. He also discussed the plan with his uncle in Pakistan, who agreed to help by checking with his contacts on whether they could provide fake documents to certify Talat's purported death. Abraham's two cousins in Pakistan helped to convey messages between him and his uncle to facilitate the procurement of the fake documents. The three men are still at large. Abraham and his mother travelled to Islamabad on June 29 last year. He told her the following month that he managed to obtain the forged documents. She gave him her NRIC and passport before he returned to Singapore alone. Abraham reported her ""death"" to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority here. He then submitted claims to the CPF Board as well as AXA Insurance, MSIG Insurance, Great Eastern Life Assurance and NTUC Income. He also engaged a lawyer to assist in matters pertaining to Talat's ""death"". On Nov 19 last year, Abraham affirmed an affidavit before a Commissioner of Oaths stating that his mother died on July 5 that year. DPP Chin said: ""When AXA and MSIG received the insurance claims, they hired surveyors to authenticate the claims after discovering irregularities in the documents submitted. It was then discovered that the accused also made similar death benefit insurance claims with other insurers."" When the surveyors asked Abraham for the burial address of Talat, he gave them the address where his grandmother's tomb is located, said DPP Chin. After more discrepancies were uncovered, AXA alerted the police on Nov 13 last year. Subsequent investigations revealed that Talat was living in Pakistan. Arrangements were then made for her to return to Singapore on Nov 29. Abraham has made no restitution. Yesterday, defence lawyer Trent Ng urged Judge Tan to sentence Talat to a maximum of six months in jail, stressing that she had played ""an entirely passive role"". Mr Ng also pleaded for Abraham to be jailed for no more than two years and two months. ""The accused is genuinely remorseful for his acts and accepts that he should have been more thoughtful and discerning in his choices,"" he added. Before sentencing, Judge Tan said that the offences had a ""transnational element"" and investigations had been difficult. "

The 62-year-old businessman, Ho Soo Fong, was the majority shareholder and a director of Invest-Ho Properties in 2012, police said in a statement on Thursday. As the director of Invest-Ho, he allegedly consented to the company extending loans of about $2 million to eight borrowers, securing each loan on the property of the borrower. This was despite the company not having the licence to conduct moneylending activities. The eight properties on which the loans were secured include flats in Bukit Batok, Jurong West and Tampines, as well as a landed property in Sembawang, according to court documents. Meanwhile, Leong Pek Gan, 65, then a conveyancing lawyer, is suspected of helping Invest-Ho in its moneylending activities by drafting various Option to Purchase and Power of Attorney documents related to the properties used to secure the loans. This was said to be done to disguise the loans as conveyancing transactions. The third individual, Ho Quan Teng, 36, is accused of collecting loan repayments and updating records of the loans and their repayments. It is unclear if Ho Soo Fong and Ho Quan Teng are related. If convicted, the trio each face a jail term of up to four years and a fine of $30,000 to $300,000. Leong is also accused of failing to disclose suspicious transactions to the police and faces seven more charges under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. If found guilty, she can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $250,000, or both. "

She also noted that the probation report had found Siow suitable for probation as his academic results show he has the ""potential to excel in life"". Siow, 23, was given 21 months of supervised probation after pleading guilty to one charge of outraging the modesty of a 28-year-old woman. Two similar charges were taken into consideration. The National University of Singapore (NUS) student was on a train on the North East Line heading towards Punggol station at about 11.30pm on Sept 12 last year when he noticed a woman with ""very long legs"" in a pair of shorts. He sat next to her and felt the urge to touch her, the court heard. When he used his left hand to touch the outside of her right thigh, she shifted away from him and crossed her legs. When Siow touched her right thigh again, she moved to another seat, and later alighted at Serangoon station. But Siow followed her as he felt the urge to touch her again. As she was on an escalator, he stood behind her and used his finger to touch her buttocks over her shorts. The woman turned around and shouted at him as he walked quickly towards the control station. She told a station officer she had been molested and pointed to Siow as he was leaving the station. The woman made a police report about 1½ hours later. The New Paper previously reported that the police arrested a suspect in Hougang Avenue 5 three days later. After Siow's conviction in a previous hearing, the court called for a probation suitability report. Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Chan on Wednesday said the prosecution objected to probation for Siow and urged the court to jail him for six weeks instead. He noted that Siow had admitted in the probation report to committing similar acts since he enrolled in NUS in 2016. DPP Chan said it was troubling that Siow was unable to recall the number of times he had committed such acts. Calling them a ""deep-seated habit"", he added: ""The accused knew it was wrong but was emboldened after previous successes. He only sought help after facing the university's Board of Discipline."" DPP Chan added that Siow was ""normal in every sense"" and did not suffer from any disorder. But Judge Kaur questioned the prosecution's position on sentencing, saying that Siow had an inability to control his urges. She said: ""Looking at the nature of intrusion, I would say it is minor."" When DPP Chan pointed out that Siow had committed three such acts, she acknowledged this but reiterated that ""they were minor"". When he said two of the acts involved skin-to-skin contact, Judge Kaur said that it was ""just a brief touch on the thigh"". Urging the court to grant probation, Siow's lawyer Raphael Louis said his client would be graduating from NUS in one to two years. ""He's getting help, he wants to change, he has learnt his lesson,"" he said. When he asked Judge Kaur if she would like to hear the defence's position should probation not be called for, she said there was no need. Noting his academic results and the recommendation for probation, the judge said: ""I think there can be no doubt that there is extremely strong propensity for reform. ""He was 22 years old when he committed the offences... and the nature of the acts (is) relatively minor."" Apart from the supervised probation, Siow was also ordered to perform 150 hours of community service, and his parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour. Addressing Siow, the judge said: ""I have every confidence you will not re-offend and hope you don't disappoint me."" After the sentence was handed out, DPP Chan asked the court for a stay of execution for 14 days so that the prosecution can consider its position on the judgment. But Judge Kaur did not grant the request, and said the prosecution could go ahead and file an appeal if it wished to do so. Siow is getting help at NUS to manage his sexual urges, and is expected to be back in school, the court heard. When contacted by TNP on Wednesday, the victim said she was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the outcome of the case. For each count of outrage of modesty, Siow could have been jailed for up to two years, fined and/or caned. An NUS spokesman told TNP that Siow faced disciplinary sanctions, including the suspension of candidature and mandatory counselling, at a Board of Discipline hearing last October. Stressing that NUS takes a serious view of student misconduct, the spokesman said disciplinary sanctions will form part of the student's formal educational record at the university. In June, NUS  This followed a public outcry over  The new measures include a notation on the transcript of offenders, which can be removed on request three years after graduation.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Yong had said in an earlier hearing that Visvanathan entered the area behind the cashier counter and pointed the knife at the cash register, while shouting at the cashier to open it. The woman complied out of fear and he took more than $1,000 from the register before riding away. Police arrested him about four hours later. Visvanathan was charged in court with armed robbery two days later and was out on bail when police rearrested him on Sept 15, 2017, for suspected drug-related offences.

Song, who worked at Grace Lodge nursing home in Sengkang from June 1 to Aug 11, 2017, was sentenced to eight months' jail over these three charges. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sunil Nair said the Central Provident Fund Board routinely mails cheques under the Silver Support Scheme to the home. The initiative provides retirement assistance for people who have had low incomes throughout their lives. As part of her job, Song opened mail and filed the cheques into residents' case files. In July 2017, she was entrusted with seven cheques for $600 each. After preparing authorisation letters and indemnity forms, she obtained the home director's approval to encash the cheques on the residents' behalf. But she later decided to keep the monies for herself and resigned on Aug 11, 2017. The home found out what she had done during an audit in September last year. In separate cases, she persuaded two other elderly men under her care to activate their ATM cards before making off with their money. Song accompanied Mr Ho Park Tong, 77, and Mr Han Lee Fong, 80, during the activation process and noted down their personal identification numbers. She later went to several ATMs in July 2017 to withdraw cash and make transfers from the men's bank accounts. The court heard that from July 3 to 17, 2017, Song misappropriated nearly $40,700 from Mr Ho's account. She also accessed Mr Han's account from July 27 to 29 that year to perform 23 transfers and withdrawals totalling nearly $7,000. Song threw away the cards after committing the offences. The offences involving the ATM transactions came to light in January last year when her replacement checked the two victims' bank statements and spotted suspicious transactions. The police were alerted later that month. Song has since made full restitution. For each count of criminal breach of trust, she could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

The court heard that the children's grandmother learnt about what he had done on the third occasion on Oct 12, and alerted the police at around 12.30pm the same day. Officers arrested the man at the flat and took him to Bedok Police Division. Swabs were taken from the girl, and the father's DNA profile was found on her lower back. The swabs also tested positive for prostate-specific antigen, a protein found in body fluids such as semen and blood. Prosecutors said that the girl, her brother and their mother gave police statements that incriminated the man, but that during the trial, they ""distanced themselves"" from the incriminating contents.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Cheng Yuxi said that as an accountant, Salamanes' responsibilities included handling items such as balance sheets as well as profit-and-loss statements. He also had access to his employer's chequebooks linked to two bank accounts. He was later authorised to sign singly on the cheques for payments of any amount up to $10,000. The court heard that he misappropriated the money from April 23, 2013, to June 13, 2017. After receiving the ill-gotten gains, Salamanes would withdraw most of the monies and remit them overseas via remittance agencies. The remittances to the Philippines were to bank accounts belonging to Salamanes as well as his family and friends, said the DPP. She added: ""To ensure that his misdeeds would go undetected, he instructed others to make false entries into the company's electronic accounting system, making them believe the cheque payments were legitimate. He did this by sending them photocopied 'dummy cheques' he created, which contained false recipient names... and fictitious purposes for the payments. ""The accused created each dummy cheque as follows: First, he filled in the amount and date, but not the payee name on the original cheque. He then signed the original cheque, and photocopied it. Finally, he wrote a payee name on the photocopied cheque, which was usually the name of a random employee of QlikTech."" Following an internal investigation in June 2017, QlikTech's finance director alerted the police about three months later. Salamanes has made no restitution, but the court heard that QlikTech managed to claim about US$2.86 million (S$3.9 million) from its insurer, which was almost the entire sum misappropriated. For each count of criminal breach of trust, Salamanes could have been jailed for up to 15 years and fined. "

The 40-year-old man was also ordered to receive nine strokes of the cane. He was convicted of four counts of molestation last week. He cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the girl's identity. During the trial, the court heard that the man first molested the girl in their flat in the eastern part of Singapore on Sept 13, 2015. The girl later told her mother about what he had done and the woman confronted her husband the following day. He cried and begged for forgiveness but then went on to accost his daughter thrice in 2016 after she turned 13. The court heard that the girl's grandmother learnt about what he had done on the third occasion on Oct 12 and alerted the police at around 12.30pm the same day. Officers arrested the man at the flat and took him to Bedok Police Division. Swabs were taken from the girl and the father's DNA profile was found on her lower back. The swabs also tested positive for prostate-specific antigen, a protein found in body fluids such as semen and blood. Prosecutors stated that the girl, her brother and their mother had given police statements that incriminated the man, but during the trial ""distanced themselves"" from the incriminating contents. Deputy Public Prosecutors Yvonne Poon and Tan Zhongshan said in their submissions: ""(The girl) had a strong motive to lie to protect the accused when testifying in court. (She) testified that she loved the accused and did not want anything bad to happen to him.""

Gopal Krishna Raju, 37, who was a manager in a food processing firm, ran a side business transporting gold from Singapore to Chennai, where the valuables were sold. The Indian national had asked airport check-in worker Patel Hiteshkumar Chandubhai, 37, to under-report the weight of bags belonging to passengers who were transporting the gold on Gopal's behalf. Patel was then rewarded for his help. In sentencing Gopal, District Judge John Ng said the offence had taken place over 10 months and stressed that it is important to protect Changi Airport's reputation. Gopal pleaded guilty last Friday to a corruption charge. He had committed the offence on at least 10 occasions between January and October 2016. He is the fourth person to be dealt with in court this year over bribes given to customer service associates at the airport. All three of the customer service associates unlawfully accepted bribes, but only one of them, Patel, had accepted the cash from Gopal. The other two - Gerizim Kirubai Raj Deved, 35, and Ayyadurai Karunanithi, 47 - were involved in other cases. Gerizim is a former Sats Asia-Pacific Star employee, while Patel and Ayyadurai worked for logistics service provider UBTS. They were each sentenced in April to between seven and nine weeks' jail, and were ordered to pay between $500 and $800 in penalties. Gerizim is a Singaporean while the other two are Indian nationals. The cases involving Gerizim and Ayyadurai were not linked to Gopal's. Gopal and Patel knew each other through mutual friends. The court heard that Gopal would not use a courier service for his gold business. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh had said that Gopal would look for passengers - either his friends or strangers - travelling to Chennai and ask them if they would carry gold to pass to his relatives there, with the relatives then giving them a sum of money. In January 2016, Gopal asked for Patel's help to under-report the weight of such passengers' bags and the airport check-in worker agreed to assist him in exchange for bribes. The offences came to light after The New Paper published a report in July last year on a baggage-touting syndicate operating at Changi Airport. Offenders convicted of corruption can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000. "

Then on Aug 27, police received several reports from victims of car rental scams. They had responded to car rental ads on online portal Carousell and paid deposits of between $200 and $400 via bank transfer, but they could not contact the advertiser after that. The police said that officers from Bedok Police Division identified three men - aged between 18 and 23 - to be behind the car rental and sexual service scams and arrested them. At least seven victims were involved in the scams.

This caused Teo, 58, to react by swerving to his left in the direction of British national Eric Cheung Hoyu, 35, who then fell off his bicycle, said Teo's lawyer Chia Boon Teck. But there was no contact between the lorry and the bicycle during the Pasir Ris incident, said Mr Chia yesterday on the first day of trial for Teo. The incident, which was captured on video and went viral online, took place at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Pasir Ris Rise just before noon on Dec 22 last year. In the video, which has garnered more than three million views, Cheung is seen hitting the left side mirror of Teo's lorry. The lorry then suddenly swerves to the left in the direction of Cheung, who falls off his bicycle and onto the grass verge on the side of the road. Both Cheung and Teo were later arrested, within three days of the incident. Earlier this year, Cheung pleaded guilty to two charges, for committing mischief and causing obstruction by riding his bicycle in the middle of the lane instead of the leftmost side. He was fined $2,800 on April 12. Teo is contesting his two charges - one for acting rashly as to cause hurt to Cheung, and the other for failing to make a police report within 24 hours of the accident. If convicted of the first charge, Teo could be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. If convicted of the second charge, he could be jailed for up to three months or fined up to $1,000 as a first-time offender. Among the witnesses called to the stand yesterday was taxi driver Ong Joo Kin, who was driving on the right of Teo's lorry at the time of the incident. Mr Ong said he did honk at the lorry, which was trying to cut into his lane. Meanwhile, the second cyclist in the incident, Mr Nigel Harper, told the court that after Cheung fell off his bicycle, Teo parked his lorry on the side of the road. As he was approaching Cheung, Teo appeared ""upset and quite angry that his side mirror had been broken"", said Mr Harper. ""That was the primary conversation,"" he added. When asked by Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong how he would compare his own reaction to Cheung with Teo's reaction, Mr Harper said: ""My response was to check if (Cheung) was okay. The driver didn't appear to be concerned about (Cheung), he was just pointing repeatedly at his wing mirror.""

The 29-year-old Indonesian committed the offence as she was jealous of the other maid, who was working for her boss' sister-in-law. The offender felt that the 25-year-old Myanmar national needed only to take care of the baby, while she had to do all household chores. The older woman was sentenced yesterday to three years' jail after pleading guilty to attempting to cause the three-month-old girl to consume a mixture of milk powder and detergent. She cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the child's identity. The baby did not consume any of the tainted milk, and the court heard there was no evidence the Indonesian had been abused or ill-treated. Deputy Public Prosecutor Zhou Yang said the maid started working for the baby's uncle in April 2015. On certain occasions, the man, his sister-in-law and their family members would stay together. The two maids would also come along to the house near Hougang Avenue 1, the court heard. Consumed by her jealousy of the other helper, the Indonesian maid mixed detergent into the baby's milk powder on Sept 6 last year. The next day, when the child's mother used the contaminated mixture to make milk, she spotted some black and pink particles at the bottom of the baby's milk bottle. The DPP said: ""(The mother) put the first milk bottle aside, used another milk bottle to make milk using the contaminated milk powder, and this time she noticed blue particles in the milk bottle."" When she opened the tin containing the contaminated milk powder, she detected a smell from it similar to that of detergent. Sensing something amiss, she used breast milk to feed her baby instead. The next day, on Sept 8, the Indonesian maid's boss alerted the police about the contaminated milk powder and told the officers he thought the maid was the only suspect. DPP Zhou said a Health Sciences Authority report on Aug 29 this year stated that when exposed to detergents, children below the age of six can experience effects such as vomiting and choking. Exposure to detergents may also cause moderate effects, such as diarrhoea, to severe ones, such as caustic injury to the gastrointestinal tract. District Judge Prem Raj said the case involved an innocent and defenceless baby, adding that the maid had ""no qualms"" using an infant ""as a tool to create problems"" for another maid. For committing the offence, the maid could have been jailed for up to five years and fined. "

This means former regional IT manager Tay Wee Kiat will serve a total jail term of six years and one month for abusing both maids. His wife, former senior sales manager Chia Yun Ling, 43, will serve a total term of four years and one month. Tay and Chia had been given two sets of sentences, arising out of two separate trials and appeals. The commencement date for the first set of sentences had been put on hold pending the conclusion of the second set of proceedings. On Friday, a panel of three judges agreed with prosecutors that the two sets of sentences should run one after the other. ""We do not see any valid reason for the sentences to commence on an earlier date as that would virtually enable the accused persons to evade punishment entirely for one set of offences,"" said Justice See Kee Oon. In lieu of paying compensation of $17,850 to the two maids, Tay will have to serve another six weeks, while Chia will have to serve an additional five weeks and 10 days. The court, which also comprised Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang, declined a request by the prosecution for examination and seizure of the couple's assets as a consequence of not paying compensation. The court noted that the prosecution had elected to seek default jail terms, among other mechanisms prescribed by law. ""If the prosecution had wanted to seek orders for examination and garnishment, the necessary directions ought to have been sought at the last hearing before us."" Tay and Chia had abused their maids in mostly separate incidents over a period of almost two years. The exception was an incident in which Tay kicked the two maids after making them get into a push-up position. He also ordered the two maids to slap each other 10 times, and forced them to bow and get up in front of a Buddhist altar 100 times, even though one was a Muslim and the other a Christian. Tay had forced Ms Fitriyah, an Indonesian who goes by one name, to stand on one leg on a stool while holding another stool above her head, with a bottle shoved into her mouth. Chia had force-fed Ms Moe Moe Than a mixture of rice and sugar through a funnel. When the Myanmar maid threw up as a result, Chia scolded her and  The couple were first convicted and sentenced in 2017 for abusing Ms Fitriyah. In March last year, following the prosecution's appeal, Tay's jail term for abusing Ms Fitriyah was increased from 28 months to 43 months. Chia's jail term remained at two months. In March this year, the couple were convicted and sentenced for abusing Ms Moe Moe Than. They started serving their sentences for this set of charges on March 27. In August, Tay's jail term for abusing Ms Moe Moe Than was increased from 24 months to 30 months after an appeal by the prosecution. There was no change to Chia's jail term of 47 months. On Friday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wen Hsien argued the two sets of sentences should run consecutively to each other. Consecutive sentences would reflect the couple's total criminality, the DPP argued, noting that there were multiple charges for unrelated offences against two different victims. "

The suspects include an 18-year-old Singaporean teenager found with 345g of cannabis, which CNB noted was enough to feed the addiction of 49 abusers for a week. He was arrested at a Housing Board void deck near Serangoon North Avenue 1 and is being treated as a suspected drug trafficker. Officers also found a digital weighing scale in his residential unit. In a second operation on Thursday, four men were caught. Three were linked to heroin, with one among them, a 48-year-old Singaporean man, suspected to be a trafficker. Officers observed the 48-year-old and a 30-year-old Malaysian man meeting at a multi-storey carpark near Woodlands Avenue 6. After the Singaporean man left the carpark in a van, CNB arrested the Malaysian and found $3,000 on him. Later, officers intercepted the van at the junction of Gambas Avenue and Sembawang Road, where the Singaporean man seen at the carpark was arrested, together with another Singaporean 49-year-old also in the van.

Gopal Krishna Raju, who was a manager in a food processing firm, ran a side business where he bought gold in Singapore to send to Chennai, India. The gold is sold there. To avoid excess baggage charges, the 37-year-old approached airport check-in worker Patel Hiteshkumar Chandubhai and asked him to under-report the weight of bags belonging to passengers who were transporting the gold on Gopal's behalf. He promised to reward Patel, who agreed to help him. On Friday (Sept 20), Gopal pleaded guilty to a corruption charge. He had committed the offence on at least 10 occasions between January and October 2016. He is now out on bail of $5,000 and will be sentenced on Sept 23. The Indian national is the fourth person to be convicted this year over bribes given to customer service associates at Changi Airport. On Friday, Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh said that Gopal and Patel knew each other through mutual friends. The court heard that Gopal would not use a courier service for his gold business. The DPP added: ""(He) would instead look for passengers travelling to Chennai - whether his friends or strangers - and ask if they were willing to carry gold to Chennai to pass to his relatives there. ""The accused's relatives would then give these passengers a sum of money. ""The accused would go to Changi Airport between 15 and 20 times a month to look for passengers who were willing to carry gold for him to Chennai."" In January 2016, he asked for Patel's help to under-report the weight of such passengers' bags and the airport check-in worker agreed to assist him in exchange for bribes. The offences came to light after The New Paper published a report in July last year on a baggage-touting syndicate operating at Changi Airport. DPP Koh has urged District Judge John Ng to sentence Gopal to eight weeks' jail, adding: ""Singapore has developed a hard-won reputation as a country that has no tolerance for corrupt activity. ""Any corrupt activity that takes place within the context of the air travel industry therefore threatens to severely undermine the reputation and national interests of Singapore."" Three customer service associates had earlier admitted to unlawfully accepting bribes. Besides Patel, 37, the two others are Gerizim Kirubai Raj Deved, 35 and Ayyadurai Karunanithi, 47. Gerizim is a former Sats Asia-Pacific Star employee while Patel and Ayyadurai worked for logistics service provider UBTS. They were each sentenced in April to between seven and nine weeks' jail. Each man was also ordered to pay between $500 and $800 in penalties. Gerizim is a Singaporean while the other two are also Indian nationals. The cases involving Gerizim and Ayyadurai were not linked to Gopal's matter. Offenders convicted of corruption can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000. "

Mr How Yuen Fah's taxi continued travelling towards Jalan Bukit Merah before hitting at least three pedestrians who were crossing the road at a traffic junction which was then showing the green man signal. One of them, Madam Tng Yew Huay, 66, was taken to the National University Hospital (NUH) where she died of a head injury at around 9.20pm that day. The other pedestrians survived. Following an inquiry on Wednesday, State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam found her death to be ""an unfortunate traffic misadventure"". She said Mr How, 72, was also taken to NUH and a scan showed the ruptured tumour. He underwent surgery and further medical investigations revealed that he had hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer of the liver. The state coroner added: ""The doctor who treated him clarified that the tumour rupture caused severe bleeding into the involved party's abdomen and a loss of blood flow to his brain. The doctor also clarified that this caused the transient period of loss of consciousness. Based on the evidence uncovered, there is no basis to suspect foul play."" Mr How started driving his taxi at around 6.30pm on March 22. He did not feel tired or sick at the time and was fully rested before he began his shift. He later picked up three passengers at a Bishan Road taxi stand and was driving past Lornie Road when he felt a sharp pain on the right side of his abdomen that subsequently went away. While travelling along Commonwealth Avenue West towards Queensway, he felt the pain on the right side of his abdomen again. He also felt pain in his neck, started breaking out in a cold sweat and his vision became blurred. He then applied medicated oil to his forehead and nose. He was driving along Queensway before the junction with Jalan Bukit Merah when he came to a stop as the traffic lights had turned red. State Coroner Kamala said the cabby recalled signalling right before he fell unconscious. She added: ""When he regained consciousness, he heard the front-seat passenger... shouting at him."" The court heard that Mr How felt pain on the right side of his abdomen. He subsequently realised that his taxi's windscreen was cracked and his vehicle was already at the junction with Alexandra Road, but he was unaware that a collision had occurred. He and Madam Tng were taken to NUH where she died about two hours later. "

South Korean An Dae Kee, 38, who worked at Seoul Education Centre in Tanglin Shopping Centre, did not pay for any of the electronic goods and devices, which were all bought on credit. He pleaded guilty last month to four cheating charges involving nearly $180,000. An also admitted to two drug-related charges and one count of possessing a knife. Another 14 charges, including cheating offences linked to the remaining amount, were considered during sentencing. To cheat his victims, An pretended to be a representative of organisations such as education group EtonHouse and integrated lifestyle firm Amara Holdings. The victims included electronics retailer Best Denki as well as telcos Singtel and StarHub. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Hsiao Tien said that between March and May last year, An submitted to his victims purchase orders for electronic goods and devices on credit terms. He then negotiated the orders through e-mail, phone calls and text messages. The victims, after agreeing to the terms, would deliver the goods to An. The court heard that on most occasions, the items were delivered to couriers he had engaged. The DPP added that An did not pay for any of the items, which were purchased on credit. After receiving reports from the victims, the police arrested An on May 3 last year in a room at Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel in Orchard Road. In his possession were a foldable knife and a clear glass tube that was later found to be stained with substances, including methamphetamine. An was taken to Tanglin Police Division where he refused to give officers a sample of his urine. He finally agreed to give a hair sample on May 9 last year and it was found to have traces of the drug. Court documents stated that An had made a partial restitution of more than $77,000.

Visvanathan Vadivelu, who was arrested on Wednesday evening, was not offered bail. The 50-year-old Singaporean will be sentenced on Sept 26 for one count of armed robbery, two counts of drug consumption and one count of drug possession - charges he had pleaded guilty to earlier this year. Visvanathan was to have been sentenced on Tuesday, but during court proceedings, he told District Judge Kan Shuk Weng that he wanted to retract his plea for all charges other than drug possession, which he admitted to. When Judge Kan asked him why he wanted to retract his plea, he replied that he has ""mental issues"". He also claimed that lawyer A. Revi Shanker, whom he had discharged on Monday, had not been ""interested"" in these issues. The judge then stood down the hearing for Mr Revi to be called to the courtroom. But when the lawyer arrived about 15 minutes later, Visvanathan was nowhere to be found. Judge Kan then issued a warrant of arrest against him. The armed robbery charge involved a Shell petrol station in Upper Bukit Timah Road. On July 31, 2017, Visvanathan used a kitchen knife to threaten a 22-year-old cashier before escaping with $1,000. He was arrested four hours later. He was charged in court and out on bail when police rearrested him on Sept 15, 2017, for suspected drug-related offences. He had a packet of a powdery substance which was later found to contain diamorphine or pure heroin. His urine samples also showed traces of the drug as well as methamphetamine, commonly known as Ice. Offenders convicted of armed robbery can be jailed for up to 10 years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane. Those over 50 years old cannot be caned. In a statement on Thursday night, police said that Visvanathan was on court bail when he appeared in court on Tuesday for sentencing for armed robbery and drug-related offences.

The mother was also told that after the man went to work, the girl complained to her grandmother that her buttocks felt sore. The girl's mother later told her daughter that she ""loved her a lot"" and asked her to tell the truth. The child said her father had rubbed his genitals against her before cleaning off with some tissue that he placed in a plastic bag. The mother retrieved the bag and confronted her husband the next day. Deputy Public Prosecutors Yvonne Poon and Tan Zhongshan stated in submissions: ""(She) told him that she knew what was going on between him and (their daughter). The accused cried and begged for forgiveness."" But he went on to molest his daughter again in September 2016, and on Oct 10 and 12 that year. The girl said that she was in the master bedroom in the morning on Oct 12 with her brother and father when the man told the boy to leave. The father then molested the girl until she felt a ""watery substance"" on her lower back. The children's grandmother learnt about what he had done and alerted the police at around 12.30pm that day.

A total of 17 workers at the Mandai Crematorium were each given a stern warning for one count of corruptly accepting gratifi-cation in the form of red packets from funeral directors and hearse drivers ""to smoothen the cremation process"", the CPIB said in a statement yesterday. As for the funeral service companies, two employees were given stern warnings for abetment to corruptly give gratification in the form of red packets to NEA staff to smoothen the cremation process at Mandai Crematorium. Twelve others from these companies were also given stern warnings for corruptly giving gratification to NEA staff. The Straits Times understands that the warnings were issued to the 31 in lieu of prosecution as there was a lack of evidence to suggest that the crematorium workers had failed to perform their duties or shown disfavour to families who did not pay red packets. The 17 workers also faced departmental disciplinary action for violating public-sector rules which disallow public officers accepting gifts and entertainment on account of their official position or official work, the CPIB added. Separately, two senior NEA officers also faced disciplinary action for failing to report the practice even though they were fully aware of it, said CPIB. In a separate statement, the NEA said it would be taking appropriate disciplinary actions against the 17 crematorium workers and two senior officers, without giving details of these actions. The statement from CPIB comes nearly a year after it was notified by the NEA of a complaint that Mandai Crematorium workers had been receiving red packets in return for preferential treatment. The Straits Times understands that the 31 crematorium workers and staff from the funeral service companies were issued the warnings yesterday. An affected funeral director, who declined to give his name, expressed relief at receiving a warning and not being prosecuted, noting that his company had stopped the practice early this year. Other funeral directors interviewed earlier by ST also noted that they had stopped the practice early this year when news of the probe broke. Those convicted of corrupt transactions could face up to five years in jail and/or a fine of up to $100,000. In its statement yesterday, the NEA said its staff from the Mandai Crematorium and Columbarium as well as Choa Chu Kang Cemetery have been reminded not to accept any red packets or gifts from members of the public. More signs have also been put up to remind the public to refrain from giving red packets or gifts to NEA staff, the agency added. Supervision of NEA officers and contractors has also been tightened, it said. The CPIB emphasised that the bureau evaluates all complaints and information it receives seriously, ""regardless of the value or nature of gratification involved"", in order to determine whether corruption offences are made out. ""Each case must be assessed on its own merits to determine if it is a case of corruption,"" it added. The bureau explained that a gift given innocently and without any corrupt intention is not considered corruption. ""However, if a gift is given or received with a view to securing, or to reciprocating with, for example an unfair advantage, it may be corruption,"" it added. "

She said Mr How, 72, was also taken to NUH and a scan showed the ruptured tumour. He went through surgery and further medical investigations revealed that he had hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer of the liver. The state coroner added: ""The doctor who treated him clarified that the tumour rupture caused severe bleeding into the involved party's abdomen and a loss of blood flow to his brain. ""The doctor also clarified that this caused the transient period of loss of consciousness. Based on the evidence uncovered, there is no basis to suspect foul play."" Mr How started driving his taxi at around 6.30pm on March 22. He did not feel tired or sick at the time and was fully rested before he began his shift. He later picked up three passengers at a Bishan Road taxi stand and was driving past Lornie Road when he felt a sharp pain in his right abdomen that subsequently went away. While travelling along Commonwealth Avenue West towards Queensway, he felt the pain in his right abdomen again.

The man outraged his daughter's modesty on three further occasions - in September and October 2016, when she was 13 - after the initial attack, a court was told. District Judge Jasvender Kaur found the 40-year-old man guilty of four counts of molestation on Thursday (Sept 19) after a trial. He cannot be named to protect the girl's identity. The man first molested the girl in their flat in the eastern part of Singapore on Sept 13, 2015. Her mother told police that when she came home from work, the girl's grandmother said that the man and the victim had spent ""quite some time"" in the master bedroom. The mother was also told that after the man went to work, the girl complained to her grandmother that her buttocks felt sore. The girl's mother later told her daughter that she ""loved her a lot"" and asked her to tell the truth. The child said her father had rubbed his genitals against her before cleaning off with some tissue that he placed in a plastic bag. The mother retrieved the bag and confronted her husband the next day. Deputy Public Prosecutors Yvonne Poon and Tan Zhongshan stated in submissions: ""(She) told him that she knew what was going on between him and (their daughter). The accused cried and begged for forgiveness."" But he went on to molest his daughter again in September 2016 and on the 10th and 12th of October. The girl said that she was in the master bedroom in the morning that day with her brother and father when the man told the boy to leave. The father then molested the girl until she felt a ""watery substance"" on her lower back. The children's grandmother learnt about what he had done and alerted the police at around 12.30pm that day. Officers arrested the man at the flat and took him to Bedok Police Division. Swabs were taken from the girl that day and the father's DNA profile was found on her lower back. The swabs also tested positive for prostate-specific antigen, a protein found in body fluids such as semen and blood. Prosecutors stated that the girl, her brother and their mother had given police statements that incriminated the man but during the trial, they ""distanced themselves"" from the incriminating contents.

Such culprits were not subject to any minimum sentences in the past. This new indicative sentence was laid out by the High Court in a new sentencing guideline for anonymous criminal intimidation cases, following the unsuccessful appeal of a disgruntled insurance agent who called himself ""Lord Voldermort"" to intimidate and harass his clients. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon dismissed the appeal of Ye Lin Myint, 36, on July 19, noting that Ye's sentence of two years and five months' jail by a district judge was ""on the low side"", and not ""manifestly excessive"", as Ye's lawyers had contended. Ye had earlier pleaded guilty to 13 charges of criminal intimidation and harassment. In judgment grounds issued yesterday, Chief Justice Menon said there is a dearth of the authorities dealing with cases of criminal intimidation involving anonymous communication. ""This calls for sentencing guidelines from the High Court to assist lower courts in sentencing such offences consistently,"" he said. He laid out a new sentencing framework, which involves taking into account factors relating to the culpability of the culprit, and the harm caused. There are nine different sentencing ranges and the appropriate range of sentences will be identified using a combination of the culpability and harm factors. The sentences will then be adjusted to account for aggravating factors such as lack of remorse, or mitigating factors such as a guilty plea. Applying this new sentencing framework to Ye's case, Chief Justice Menon found that his aggregate sentence should have been around 34 months' jail. Factors weighing against him included the fact that Ye was ""motivated by malice and greed"", said Chief Justice Menon, pointing out that Ye had made a wide range of threats to his clients, prospective clients, and their friends and families. He had been upset with them for not turning up at scheduled appointments, cancelling policies, or declining to buy the policies. Between August and September 2017, Ye sent his victims threatening letters and e-mails. As the prosecution did not appeal against the sentence, Chief Justice Menon said, he decided not to order a higher sentence, and dismissed Ye's appeal. "

In a written judgment yesterday, the High Court found that Mr Ng Kong Yeam, 80, intended to benefit Madam Kay Swee Pin, 66, when he transferred 799,999 shares in Natwest Holdings to her in 2010. Natwest was set up by Mr Ng, a Malaysian, to hold his Singapore assets. It owns SA Tours and a $4 million Cairnhill apartment that was home to Mr Ng and Madam Kay for two decades. After the share transfer, Madam Kay became its sole owner. Mr Ng moved back with his Malaysian family in July 2013 on Madam Kay's suggestion. He was declared mentally incapacitated in December that year. In 2016, his legal wife Ling Towi Sing, now 80, and children - Gabriel, 43, Irene, 55, and Iris, 47 - sued Madam Kay on his behalf, seeking to reverse the transfer. Madam Kay's daughter with Mr Ng, 32-year-old Eva Mae, was also named as a defendant. The Ngs initially accused Madam Kay of fraud, alleging that she had filled in the share transfer form and lodged it without Mr Ng's knowledge and consent. But this claim was eventually abandoned. At the close of the trial, their main argument was that the shares had been transferred to Madam Kay for her to hold in trust for Mr Ng. Madam Kay, who was represented by Mr Suresh Damodara, argued that Mr Ng had given the shares to her to provide for her and their daughter. She pointed out that she and Mr Ng managed SA Tours together and lived as a family for two decades. She submitted documents, including an e-mail from Mr Ng stating that he would leave SA Tours to her, after she alleged that he had an affair and a sexual addiction. The plaintiffs, represented by Senior Counsel Roderick Martin, asserted that Mr Ng did not intend to benefit Madam Kay because the relationship between the two had broken down. They submitted a letter, in which Madam Kay purportedly wrote that it was time to move on. Mr Ng replied on the same sheet of paper, agreeing to her suggestion. They also relied on a will that Mr Ng made in February 2012, bequeathing his Natwest shares to Gabriel and Eva Mae. They argued that this shows Mr Ng still saw himself as the owner of the shares. A video recording of the will-making exercise was played in court. In his judgment, Judicial Commissioner Vincent Hoong said Madam Kay's version of events was supported by documented evidence, whereas allegations of a breakdown in their relationship were not. He also found the letter and the 2012 will to be ""highly suspicious"". He noted: ""One would not expect physical letters to be exchanged on a single sheet of paper, since the recipient of a letter would naturally reply to the sender on a fresh sheet."" As for the video, the judge said it was clear Mr Ng was ""merely reading aloud the contents of the will verbatim"" and the ""mechanistic nature"" of the exercise cast serious doubts on whether the will was a true reflection of Mr Ng's wishes. Madam Kay told The Straits Times she was extremely relieved by the verdict. ""My whole life was at stake - my home and my work."" "

Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said that Allen Vincent Hui Kim Seng's offence showed ""cold-bloodedness"" and premeditation. The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in July to one count of intentionally abetting ""Camorra Hitmen"" to kill Mr Tan Han Shen, 30. The website's name could be a reference to the Camorra, an Italian mafia-type crime syndicate. Last week, defence lawyer Lee Teck Leng pleaded for a sentence of 2½ years in jail, stressing that ""Camorra Hitmen"" was a scam, and highlighted articles to support this notion. One of them, which appeared in July last year on British newspaper The Times' website, was entitled ""Hire-a-hitman website is a scam and its owner has made a killing"". The other, entitled ""The unbelievable tale of a fake hitman, a kill list, a darknet vigilante... and a murder"", was published in Wired magazine last December. Yesterday, Judge Shaiffudin said that Mr Lee's argument that ""Camorra Hitmen"" was a scam was not a mitigating factor as Hui truly believed he had engaged a hitman. The risk management executive started an extramarital relationship with Ms Ng Woan Man, 30, on April 22, 2016, but she ended the affair in February last year when she realised he had no intention of leaving his wife. Ms Ng started dating Mr Tan about two months later. On May 6 last year, Hui went on the Dark Web, accessed the ""Camorra Hitmen"" website and asked for Mr Tan's right hand to be cut off. He later asked for the younger man to be killed in a staged car accident, and the murder was to take place between 7pm and 8pm on May 22 that year. Hui was told that he would need to pay the hitman only after the job was completed. Before that, he had to transfer sufficient bitcoins into his account on the ""Camorra Hitmen"" website as proof of his ability to pay. The court heard that, meanwhile, a ""British vigilante"" known as Mr Chris Monteiro provided United States-based media company CBS with details about conversations from the ""hitmen website"". On May 12 last year, a CBS journalist contacted the Singapore Embassy in Washington and informed it about the ""hit"". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs alerted the Singapore Police Force, and officers arrested Hui five days later. No one was injured or killed in this case. "

Boh Soon Ho, a 51-year-old Malaysian, told himself that ""since (the woman) had died and I have never seen her naked before, I should undress her"", the High Court heard yesterday on the first day of his murder trial. The cafeteria worker has been charged with strangling Chinese national Zhang Huaxiang with a towel between 12.15pm and 5.50pm on March 21, 2016, at his rented Circuit Road bedroom. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment or the death penalty. ""This is a case of a murder driven by jealousy, rage and unrequited desire,"" Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Kok Weng said in his opening address. The DPP told the court that Boh considered Ms Zhang to be his girlfriend as they went shopping and had meals together, even though they had never been physically intimate. Boh also bought her gifts. The two got to know each other some time in 2011 or 2012, when Ms Zhang was working part-time at the staff cafeteria at Marina Bay Sands while studying nursing. After graduating, she started working at the National University Hospital. Days before the killing, on March 18, Boh saw Ms Zhang getting into a taxi with a man after leaving her flat. He felt jealous and believed that she was cheating on him. He then arranged for her to go over to his place for a steamboat lunch on March 21. When he saw her combing her hair in his room, he tried to have sex with her, but she rejected his advances, telling him ""Crazy, go away"" in Mandarin. Ten minutes later, he again tried to force himself on her, putting an armlock around her neck and dragging her into his room, but she put up a fierce struggle. When he confronted her about the man who was with her, she told him that she had gone out with the man on four to five occasions. She also told him that she was still communicating with her former boyfriend in China and that it was normal for them to be intimate. On hearing this, Boh became furious. He took a bath towel, looped it around her neck and pulled it for about two minutes until there was no sign of life. He noticed that her face had darkened as he carried her body to his bed. He took off her clothes and still wanted to have sex with her as he felt he could do what he wished, now that she could no longer resist him. However, he was unable to perform sexually. He then put her panties back on, covered the body with a blanket and washed their clothes in the washing machine. Boh then packed his clothes in preparation to leave Singapore, keeping Ms Zhang's phone and cash. He sent a text message to his supervisor saying he was going back to Malaysia for a month, and phoned his landlord to say that he would be vacating the room within the next few days. He then went to Geylang to buy a suitcase, and returned to the flat. He initially thought of putting the body in his own suitcase and dumping it in Sembawang, but the body was too stiff. He considered dismembering it, but did not do so. He then spent the night sleeping next to the body. The next morning, on March 22, he put clothes on the body, covered it with a blanket and told the victim to rest in peace. He then went out to meet a friend to sell off some items, and also went to collect his salary. At about 10.50am, he returned to repack his clothes and the towel in his suitcase. He kissed the body on the forehead and left the lights and air-conditioner switched on. He took a taxi to Woodlands Checkpoint, and after clearing Customs, took another taxi to his younger sister's home in Melaka, where he immediately confessed to her. She then found a rented room for him to stay. That evening, his landlord in Singapore, Mr Chai Yong Siong, saw a figure lying on Boh's bed and assumed his tenant was asleep. One hour later, after returning from dinner, Mr Chai called out ""hello, hello"" and when there was no response, he pulled the blanket away. He called the police after finding the body. The following morning, Mr Chai received a call from Boh, who told him he had strangled Ms Zhang and was in Kuala Lumpur. Mr Chai contacted the police and was briefed on what to expect should Boh call again. The landlord also sent text messages to Boh's Malaysian number in the presence of a police officer. At about 2.40pm, Boh called Mr Chai and they spoke for about 10 minutes. The conversation was recorded by the police. The landlord continued texting Boh over the next two weeks, while keeping the police in the loop on the exchanges. On April 4, 2016, Boh was arrested by the Malaysian police while he was having dinner at a restaurant. He was brought back to Singapore the next day. A report from the Institute of Mental Health said Boh is not intellectually disabled and does not suffer from any mental disorder. In statements to the police, he admitted strangling Ms Zhang because he was furious with her and wanted to kill her. Boh is defended by Mr Eugene Thuraisingam. It was previously reported that Ms Zhang received a scholarship in 2009 to study nursing in Singapore. She was the first person from her village in Hunan to get a scholarship overseas. Her funeral was handled for free by undertaker Roland Tay. The trial continues. "

Police said on Wednesday (Sept 18) that he was arrested on Sept 7, after they received a report lodged by an 18-year-old woman the previous day. Posing as a woman on Instagram, the accused had pretended to offer free clothes and cash to the victim in return for her advertising the clothes on her social media account. After she agreed, the suspect then requested to meet up with the woman to get her body measurements before the clothes were sent to her. The accused claimed that ""she"" was unable to meet the victim on the day of the meetup, telling the victim to meet ""her"" brother instead. The suspect then took her to a residential unit where, pretending to take her body measurements, he got the victim to undress herself. He then molested her. Police said the man did not provide clothes or payment to the victim as initially offered. The accused is believed to be involved in other outrage of modesty cases, and is assisting with police investigations. Police advised the public to be wary of strangers who make dubious modelling job offers on social media platforms, especially those that require them to send compromising photos or undress for body measurements. They also advised the public not to meet online acquaintances alone. Anyone convicted for outrage of modesty can be jailed for up to two years, fined and/or caned. "

In a written judgment on Wednesday (Sept 18), the High Court found that Mr Ng Kong Yeam, 80, intended to benefit Madam Kay Swee Pin, 66, when he transferred 799,999 shares in Natwest Holdings to her in 2010. Natwest was set up in the 1980s by Mr Ng, a Malaysian, to hold his Singapore assets. It owns SA Tours and a $4 million Cairnhill apartment that was home to Mr Ng and Madam Kay for two decades. After the share transfer, Madam Kay, who originally held one share in Natwest, became its sole owner. Mr Ng moved back with his Malaysian family in July 2013 on Madam Kay's suggestion. He was declared mentally incapacitated by the Malaysian courts in December that year. In 2016, his legal wife, Madam Ling Towi Sing, now 80, and children - Gabriel, 43, Irene, 55, and Iris, 47 - sued Madam Kay on his behalf, seeking to reverse the share transfer. Madam Kay's daughter with Mr Ng, 32-year-old Eva Mae, was also named as a defendant. The Ng family initially accused Madam Kay of fraud, alleging that she had filled in the share transfer form and lodged it without Mr Ng's knowledge and consent. But this claim was eventually abandoned. At the close of trial, their main argument was that shares had been transferred to Madam Kay for her to hold in trust for Mr Ng, who was the beneficial owner. Madam Kay, who was represented by Mr Suresh Damodara, argued that Mr Ng had given the shares to her to provide for her and their daughter. She pointed out that she and Mr Ng managed SA Tours together and lived as a family unit for two decades. Madam Kay submitted documents, including an e-mail from Mr Ng in 2008 stating that he would leave SA Tours to her in his will, after she alleged that he had an ""affair"" and a ""sexual addiction"". The plaintiffs, represented by Senior Counsel Roderick Martin, asserted that Mr Ng did not intend to benefit Madam Kay because the relationship between the two had broken down. They submitted a letter, in which Madam Kay purportedly wrote that it was time to ""move on"". On the same sheet of paper, Mr Ng replied, agreeing to her suggestion. The Ngs also relied on a will that Mr Ng made in February 2012, bequeathing his Natwest shares to Gabriel and Eva Mae. They argued that this shows Mr Ng still saw himself as the owner of the shares. A video recording of the will-making exercise was played in court during the trial. In his judgment, Judicial Commissioner Vincent Hoong said Madam Kay's version of events was inherently consistent and supported by documented evidence. On the other hand, the judge said allegations of a breakdown in the relationship between Mr Ng and Madam Kay was unsupported by evidence. The judge also found the letter and the 2012 will to be ""highly suspicious"". He noted: ""One would not expect physical letters to be exchanged on a single sheet of paper, since the recipient of a letter would naturally reply to the sender on a fresh sheet of paper."" As for the video, the judge said it was clear Mr Ng was ""merely reading aloud the contents of the will verbatim"" and the ""mechanistic nature"" of the exercise casts serious doubts on whether the will was a true reflection of Mr Ng's wishes. Contacted by The Straits Times, Madam Kay said she was extremely relieved by the decision. ""My whole life was at stake - my home and my work."" "

Such culprits were not subject to any minimum sentences in the past. This new indicative sentence was laid out by the High Court in a new sentencing guideline for anonymous criminal intimidation cases, following the unsuccessful appeal of a disgruntled insurance agent who called himself ""Lord Voldermort"" to intimidate and harass his clients. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon dismissed the appeal of Ye Lin Myint, 36, on July 19, noting that Ye's sentence of two years and five months' jail by a district judge was ""on the low side"", and not ""manifestly excessive"", as Ye's lawyers had contended. Ye had earlier pleaded guilty to 13 charges of criminal intimidation and harassment. In judgment grounds issued on Wednesday (Sept 18), Chief Justice Menon said there is a dearth of authorities dealing with cases of criminal intimidation involving anonymous communication. ""This calls for sentencing guidelines from the High Court to assist lower courts in sentencing such offences consistently,"" he said. He laid out a new sentencing framework, which involves taking into account factors relating to the culpability of the culprit, and the harm caused. There are nine different sentencing ranges and the appropriate range of sentences will be identified using a combination of the culpability and harm factors. The sentences will then be adjusted to account for aggravating factors like lack of remorse, or mitigating factors like a guilty plea. Applying this new sentencing framework to Ye's case, the Chief Justice found that his aggregate sentence should have been around 34 months' jail. Factors weighing against him included the fact that Ye was ""motivated by malice and greed"", said Chief Justice Menon, pointing out that Ye had made a wide range of threats to his clients, prospective clients, and their friends and families. He had been upset with them for not turning up at scheduled appointments, cancelling policies they bought from him, or declining to buy the policies. Between August and September 2017, Ye had sent his victims letters and e-mails threatening to humiliate them, cause them to lose their jobs, or physically harm them or their family members. He signed off the letters and e-mails as ""Lord Voldermort"" - the misspelt name of the villain, Lord Voldemort, in the popular Harry Potter franchise. However, as the prosecution did not appeal against the sentence, Chief Justice Menon said he decided not to order a higher sentence, and dismissed Ye's appeal. "

South Korean An Dae Kee, 38, who was with the Seoul Education Centre in Tanglin Shopping Centre, did not pay for any of the electronic goods and devices, which were all bought on credit. He pleaded guilty last month to four cheating charges involving nearly $180,000. An also admitted to two drug-related charges and one count of possessing a knife. Another 14 charges, including cheating offences linked to the remaining amount, were considered during sentencing. To cheat his victims, An pretended to be a representative of organisations such as education group Eton House and integrated lifestyle firm Amara Holdings. The victims included electronics retailer Best Denki as well as telcos Singtel and StarHub. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Hsiao Tien earlier said that between March and May last year, An submitted to his victims purchase orders for electronic goods and devices on credit terms. He then negotiated the orders via e-mail, phone calls and text messages. The victims, after agreeing to the terms, would deliver the goods to An. The court heard that on most occasions, the items were delivered to couriers whom he had engaged. The DPP added that An did not pay for any of the items which were purchased on credit. After receiving reports from the victims, the police arrested An on May 3 last year in a room at Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel in Orchard Road. He was found to possess items that included a foldable knife and a clear glass tube which was later found to be stained with substances, including methamphetamine. An was taken to Tanglin Police Division where he refused to give officers a sample of his urine. He finally agreed to give a hair sample on May 9 last year and it was found to have traces of the drug. Court documents stated that An had made a partial restitution of more than $77,000. For each count of cheating, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

The two got to know each other some time in 2011 or 2012, when Ms Zhang was working part time at the staff cafeteria at Marina Bay Sands resort while studying nursing. After graduating, she started working at the National University Hospital. Days before the killing, on March 18, Boh saw Ms Zhang getting into a taxi with a man after leaving her flat. He felt jealous and believed that she was cheating on him. He then arranged for her to go over to his place for a steamboat lunch on March 21. When he saw her combing her hair in his room, he tried to have sex with her but she rejected his advances, telling him ""crazy, go away!"" in Mandarin. Ten minutes later, he again tried to force himself on her, putting an arm lock around her neck and dragging her into his room, but she put up a fierce struggle.

Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said that Allen Vincent Hui Kim Seng's offence showed ""cold bloodedness"" and premeditation. The 47-year-old  The website's name could be a reference to the Camorra, an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate. Last week, defence lawyer Lee Teck Leng pleaded for a sentence of 2½ years' jail, stressing that Camorra Hitmen was a scam, and highlighted articles to support this notion. One of them, which appeared in July last year on British newspaper The Times' website, was titled ""Hire-a-hitman website is a scam and its owner has made a killing"" while the other, titled ""The unbelievable tale of a fake hitman, a kill list, a darknet vigilante... and a murder"", was published in Wired magazine last December. On Wednesday, Judge Shaiffudin said that Mr Lee's argument that Camorra Hitmen was a scam was not a mitigating factor, as Hui truly believed that he had engaged a hitman. The risk management executive started an extramarital relationship with Ms Ng Woan Man, 30, on April 22, 2016. She ended the affair in February last year when she realised he had no intention of leaving his wife. Ms Ng started dating Mr Tan about two months later. On May 6 last year, Hui went on the Dark Web, accessed the Camorra Hitmen website and asked for Mr Tan's right hand to be cut off. The Dark Web contains websites that are not indexed by search engines such as Google. It is accessible only by special software where users and website operators can remain anonymous as well as untraceable. Hui was told he would have to pay the hitman only after the job was done. But, before that, he had to transfer sufficient bitcoins into his account on the Camorra Hitmen website as proof of his ability to pay. Hui purchased 0.03 bitcoin valued at $600 on a bitcoin trading website and transferred the amount into his Camorra Hitmen account to facilitate the hit. Three days later, Hui wanted acid to be poured on Mr Tan's face and transferred about $3,000 worth of bitcoins to his Camorra Hitmen account. He then asked for a staged car accident to leave Mr Tan crippled for life, and transferred another $3,200 worth of bitcoins to the same account. Hui later changed his mind and said he wanted Mr Tan killed in a staged car accident. He asked Camorra Hitmen if they could proceed with the kill job if he added another US$1,000 (S$1,375) worth of bitcoins into his account. They agreed on the arrangement and the murder was to take place between 7pm and 8pm on May 22 that year. The court heard that meanwhile, a ""British vigilante"" known as Chris Monteiro provided US-based media company CBS with details about conversations from the ""hitmen website"". On May 12 last year, a CBS journalist contacted the Singapore Embassy in Washington and informed it about the ""hit"". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs alerted the Singapore Police Force and officers arrested Hui five days later. No one was injured or killed in this case. For intentionally abetting Camorra Hitmen to kill Mr Tan, Hui could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

The two are believed to be Mr Nafiz Kamarudin, 38, a first aid trainer, and his wife, 30. Mr Nafiz had first posted about the incident on his Facebook page last Thursday. He said the run's organisers had contacted him to change his bib as ""the message... is not in line with their cause"". His bib had read ""'2nd chances' means not killing them"", referring to the death penalty. On the race day, he used a bib that had just his name, but wore a yellow T-shirt that reproduced the same text from the previous bib. He said in another Facebook post that the organisers did not let him take part in the race, and he would be ""running parallel"" to them. Mr Nafiz, a co-founder of non-profit organisation Happy People Helping People Foundation, told socio-political news site The Online Citizen that he was called in for questioning at the Bedok police station two days after the race. Yesterday, the police confirmed they are investigating a Singaporean man, 38, and a woman, 30, under the Public Order Act, after a police report was made. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) issued a statement, saying the run's organising committee became aware that Mr Nafiz had printed the anti-death penalty phrase on his runner's bib more than a week before the event. The organisers contacted him twice on Sept 6 to explain why his bib was inappropriate, as the run should not be used ""as a platform to advocate other causes, or to campaign against existing laws"". He was offered another bib, printed with his name, but he refused. On Sept 13, the organisers contacted him for the third time, and both parties met in person. He then exchanged his bib for one bearing his name, said SPS. However, on the day of the race, Mr Nafiz and his wife turned up wearing identical T-shirts with the same message from his previous runner's bib on the front of the shirt, and on the back, the phrase #ANTIDEATHPENALTY. The organisers told him he would not be allowed to run in the T-shirt, as it was ""no different from his original intention to wear the running bib with the message printed on it"". He was offered an event T-shirt to wear instead, but he rejected the offer, ripped off his bib, threw it to the ground, then ran by himself on the public road alongside the event running route, the statement said. His wife left the event venue. When he reached the Changi Prison Complex entrance at around 8.15am, he was told he would not be let in. He stood outside until around 10am, SPS said. SPS added that the run has helped to rally support for ex-offenders, and the couple's actions are a ""disservice"" to offenders, ex-offenders and their families. It is an offence under the Public Order Act to take part in a public assembly or procession without a police permit. Anyone convicted may be fined up to $3,000. Repeat offenders may be fined up to $5,000. "

The couple were taken to court yesterday and charged with the murder of their daughter in the unit. They cannot be named due to a gag order, but the police said on Monday that the 31-year-old man and the 30-year-old woman had been in remand since June last year over other unrelated offences. The girl's death came to light only last week after the police responded to a call for assistance at 8.30pm on Sept 10. The officers entered the one-room rental flat on the eighth storey of the block and found the toddler's remains inside. The Straits Times understands that the remains had been kept inside a metal pot. The man had earlier been charged with two drug-related offences and one count of rioting. These cases are still pending. Before the woman was charged with murder, she was sentenced on Sept 9 to five years and two months in jail after she pleaded guilty to three drug-related charges and one count of theft. The couple are believed to be married with at least three children, and are the registered occupants of the flat where the remains were found. No one answered the door when ST visited the flat last Thursday. A chain with a padlock secured the gate. Neighbours said a strong smell - with one describing it as ""something rotting"" - wafted through the corridor at least a week before the body was found in the unit. Police were seen leaving the flat with a metal pot and a bag, according to Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Wanbao. Residents at the block said a man in his 20s had been living in the flat on his own for the past three or four months, and a couple with children had lived there before him. It is understood that a man was in the flat when police went there on Sept 10, but it is unclear how he is related to the couple. The couple's cases have been adjourned to next Tuesday. Offenders convicted of murder can face the death penalty. They can also be jailed for life and caned. "

When Judge Kan asked him why he wanted to retract his plea, he replied that he has ""mental issues"" and claimed that Mr Revi had not been ""interested"" in them. The judge stood down the hearing for Mr Revi to be called to the courtroom. But when the lawyer arrived about 15 minutes later, Visvanathan was nowhere to be found. Judge Kan then issued a warrant of arrest against him. Visvanathan had robbed a petrol station on July 31, 2017, as he was ""desperate for money"". He was unemployed at the time. At around noon that day, he rode his motorcycle to Upper Bukit Timah Road, stopped near an overhead bridge and used grey masking tape to cover the rear registration plate. He put on a jacket, gloves and a pair of sunglasses to conceal his identity, before retrieving a kitchen knife from the bike's storage box. He then entered a Shell petrol station. He went to the area behind the counter and approached a cashier.

The 22-year-old woman complied out of fear and Visvanathan took more than $1,000 from the register before riding away. But about four hours later, police had him in handcuffs. He was charged in court with armed robbery two days later and was out on bail when police re-arrested him on Sept 15, 2017, for suspected drug-related offences. He had a packet of powdery substance which was later found to contain diamorphine or pure heroin. His urine samples also showed traces of the drug as well as methamphetamine. "

He later sold the pawn ticket to another pawnshop for RM1,054 and used part of the proceeds for his wedding expenses. <strong>DPP Mohamed Faizal said that while the accused was alone with Madam Maimunah, he attacked her, thrusting the blades of the grass cutters into her chest. She fell and pleaded with him not to harm or kill her. She tried to get up, but he repeatedly hit her head with the grass cutters. As she gasped for air, he took her jewellery.</strong> He was apprehended by Malaysian police on Dec 18, 2016, and handed over to the Singapore police the next day at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. He was arrested upon arrival in Singapore later that day. The prosecution's case is that Ahmad Muin needed money to finance his wedding and that he had seized the opportunity to prey on a defenceless woman. The court heard that Madam Maimunah wore gold jewellery every day, even at work. Her boss, Mr Roslan Tamain, testified that she wore necklaces, bangles and anklets, as well as rings on all fingers. Ahmad Muin was employed as a cleaner on a temporary work permit and started work in late October 2016 at a monthly salary of $1,100. The court heard that he had borrowed money from Madam Maimunah and other colleagues at the ferry terminal. On Nov 8, 2016, Mr Roslan told the accused that he would be terminating his employment to cut costs. He said Ahmad Muin had told him that he needed money for his wedding and asked to continue working until he found another job. Mr Roslan said he gave $400 in salary to the accused on Nov 22, 2016, and said he would give him the remaining $100 the next day. He also told Ahmad Muin to stop working at the terminal. Another worker, Mr Raja Kumar Achalingam Krishnasamy, who helps customers call for limousine taxis, said that he had seen Ahmad Muin walking towards the storeroom and looking stressed at around noon on Nov 24, 2016. DPP Mohamed Faizal said that while the accused was alone with Madam Maimunah, he attacked her, thrusting the blades of the grass cutters into her chest. She fell and pleaded with him not to harm or kill her. She tried to get up, but he repeatedly hit her head with the grass cutters. As she gasped for air, he took her jewellery. He then pulled her body to a drain outside, removed the drain covers, pushed her in and closed the covers. At 1pm, having taken Madam Maimunah's jewellery and phone, he took a taxi to Woodlands Checkpoint, where he got on a bus to Johor. A report from the Institute of Mental Health said the accused has no major mental illness. In police statements after his arrest, Ahmad Muin said that he had attacked Madam Maimunah after she called him stupid and incompetent, and insulted his family. He is defended by Mr Hassan Esa Almenoar and Mr Rajan Supramaniam. They will be relying on psychiatric evidence in his defence. The trial continues on Sept 25. "

The duo is believed to be Mr Nafiz Kamarudin, 38, a first aid trainer, and his wife, 30, who was at the event to support him. Mr Nafiz had first posted on his Facebook account about the incident last Thursday, where he said that the Yellow Ribbon Run had contacted him to change his runner's bib as ""the message... is not in line with their cause"". His bib had read ""'2nd chances' means not killing them"", referring to the death penalty. On the day of the race, Mr Nafiz changed to another runner's bib that had just his name, but wore a yellow T-shirt that reproduced the same text from the previous bib. In another Facebook post, which was uploaded on Sunday, he said the organisers did not allow him to take part in the race, and he was ""running parallel"" to them. Mr Nafiz, who is also co-founder of non-profit organisation Happy People Helping People Foundation, later told socio-political news site The Online Citizen that he was called for questioning by the police at Bedok police station two days after the race. On Tuesday, the police confirmed in a statement that they are investigating a Singaporean man, aged 38, and a Singaporean woman, aged 30, under the Public Order Act, after a police report was made after the run against their actions. The Singapore Prisons Service (SPS) also issued a statement, saying that the organising committee for the run had become aware that Mr Nafiz printed the anti-death penalty phrase on his runner's bib more than a week before the event. The organisers then contacted Mr Nafiz twice on Sept 6 to explain to him why his bib was inappropriate, ""as the YRPR should not be used by him as a platform to advocate other causes, or to campaign against existing laws"". ""He was offered the opportunity to exchange his inappropriate bib with one printed with his name. On both occasions, he rejected the organising committee's offer despite being informed that he would be deregistered from the event and his registration fee refunded if he refused to change the bib,"" the statement added. The organisers then contacted him for the third time on Sept 13, and both parties met in person that night. ""The meeting took place and he exchanged his bib for one bearing his name, so that he could participate in the event,"" said the SPS. However, on the day of the race, Mr Nafiz and his wife turned up wearing identical T-shirts with the same anti-death penalty message from his previous runner's bib on the front of the shirt, and on the back, the words #ANTIDEATHPENALTY, said SPS. The organisers then told him that he would not be allowed to participate in the run in the T-shirt, as it was ""no different from his original intention to wear the running bib with the message printed on it"". He was offered another event T-shirt to wear instead, the statement said. ""However, he rejected the offer, ripped off his bib and threw it on the ground, and ran separately by himself on the public road that ran alongside the event running route,"" said SPS, adding that the woman then left the event venue. When Mr Nafiz reached the entrance to the Changi Prison Complex at around 8.15am, he was told that he would not be allowed in, and he stood outside until around 10am, SPS added. ""Over the past decade, this event has helped to rally community support for ex-offenders who have served their sentences and made a commitment to turn over a new leaf. The duo's actions at this year's YRPR are a disservice to offenders, ex-offenders and their families whom the Yellow Ribbon Project seeks to help,"" said SPS. Police investigations are ongoing. It is a criminal offence under the Public Order Act to take part in a public assembly or procession without a police permit. Anyone convicted may be fined up to $3,000. Repeat offenders may be fined up to $5,000. The police in their statement reminded the public that ""there are proper avenues for Singaporeans to express their views on issues"". ""For example, they can use the Speakers' Corner to carry out public assemblies and speak on these issues, without the need for a permit, subject to certain conditions being met,"" it added. In Singapore, capital punishment may be meted out for offences such as murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking above a certain quantity. In 2012, Parliament made significant changes to the Penal Code and the Misuse of Drugs Act, changing its policy from mandatory to discretionary capital punishment. "

A warrant of arrest has since been issued against Visvanathan Vadivelu, who had pleaded guilty earlier this year to an armed robbery charge, two counts of drug consumption and one count of drug possession. He was initially represented by lawyer A. Revi Shanker, but discharged the counsel on Monday. At around 4.30pm on Tuesday, Visvanathan, who was unrepresented, told District Judge Kan Shuk Weng that he wanted to retract his plea for all charges other than drug possession, which he admitted to. When Judge Kan asked him why he wanted to retract his plea, he replied that he has ""mental issues"" and claimed that Mr Revi had not been ""interested"" in them. The judge stood down the hearing for Mr Revi to be called to the courtroom. But when the lawyer arrived about 15 minutes later, Visvanathan was nowhere to be found. Judge Kan then issued a warrant of arrest against him. Visvanathan had robbed a petrol station on July 31, 2017, as he was ""desperate for money"". He was unemployed at the time. At around noon that day, he rode his motorcycle to Upper Bukit Timah Road, stopped near an overhead bridge and used grey masking tape to cover the rear registration plate. He then put on a jacket, gloves and a pair of sunglasses to conceal his identity, before retrieving a kitchen knife from the bike's storage box. He then entered a Shell petrol station. ""At 12:48pm, the accused entered the area behind the cashier counter and approached (a cashier)."" ""The accused took out the kitchen knife... and pointed it at the cash register, while shouting at the victim to open (it),"" Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Yong had said at the hearing earlier this year. The 22-year-old woman complied out of fear and Visvanathan took more than $1,000 from the register before riding away. But about four hours later, police had him in handcuffs. Visvanathan was charged in court with armed robbery two days later and was out on bail when police rearrested him on Sept 15, 2017, for suspected drug-related offences. He had a packet of a powdery substance which was later found to contain diamorphine or pure heroin. His urine samples also showed traces of the drug as well as methamphetamine, commonly known as Ice. Offenders convicted of armed robbery can be jailed for up to 10 years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane. Those over 50 years old cannot be caned. "

Mendel See Li Quan, who is now 19, pleaded guilty to one charge each of raping and robbing the 53-year-old victim on Oct 2, 2017, and a third charge of stealing $670 from another victim in September 2017. Eight other charges were taken into consideration. In passing sentence, Justice Valerie Thean said the need for rehabilitation was displaced by the violence and brutality shown by See, who wielded a chopper against the victim. See's lawyer, who sought reformative training, said he was appealing against the sentence. Bail was doubled to $100,000 pending appeal. The court heard that See, a Malaysian, got to know Singaporeans Benjamin Yong Dun Zheng and his girlfriend, Chow Chia Suan, both 23, in 2017. The trio discussed possible ways to make money and See, a Singapore permanent resident, proposed stealing from prostitutes. On Oct 1, 2017, See contacted the 53-year-old victim, a freelance sex worker, who then asked a Filipina to meet him at his Yishun condominium. See became angry when the Filipina failed to turn up and decided to ""take revenge"" on the victim. The next day, he contacted the victim, offering her $900 for her services. Arrangements were made for her to go to Yong's Yishun flat that night. After she arrived, on Yong's signal, See and Chow banged on the main door. After entering the bedroom, the two pretended to be loan sharks and made a show of threatening Yong for payment. See then pulled the victim's bag away from her, pointing a chopper at her and shouting at her not to move. Chow rifled through the bag and took two mobile phones and $100 in cash. The victim told See she wanted to go home, but he told her to take off her clothes. When she replied that there were many people about, See told Chow and Yong to go outside. See then demanded sex while holding the chopper, and the victim did as she was told. The couple did not know what he did in the room. The victim later left without her valuables and called the police after she reached home. The trio spent the money that night on food, transport and games at an Internet gaming shop. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong sought nine years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane. She argued that despite his age, See was viewed by his accomplices as a peer; the fact that they complied with his order to leave the room showed he was ""clearly no follower"". See's lawyer, Mr Siraj Shaik Aziz, assigned under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, argued for him to be sent for reformative training. In letters submitted to the court, See said he regretted mixing with bad company, while his parents blamed themselves for being too occupied with work and not spending enough time with him. See said his dream was to be a pilot. ""However, I am afraid that... my mistake and the punishment I receive will result in me losing the opportunity to pursue my dream,"" he wrote. A letter signed by his parents said: ""Sometimes, I even get a naive thought on why is it that I am not able to serve the term on behalf of my child."" In January, Yong was sentenced to 31/2 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Chow was sentenced to four years' jail, for their roles. "

On May 18, a victim told the police he had been cheated by a woman he had met on an online platform. The woman could not be contacted after payment was made. In a separate but similar cheating incident, a man told the police on June 16 that he had been asked to make an advance payment to a woman's bank account in exchange for sexual services. Again, the woman could not be contacted after payment was made. Officers from the Woodlands Police Division identified a 34-year-old woman suspect and arrested her on Sept 6. Last Thursday, officers from the same division arrested a 22-year-old man who is believed to have masqueraded as a woman on online platforms to cheat victims. The police said the two suspects are believed to be involved in similar cases of credit-for-sex scams islandwide. Those convicted of cheating may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The number of credit-for-sex scams in the first half of this year has more than doubled from the same period last year, the police said. The comparative half-year figures are 456 cases against 209. The total amount involved in these cases was $1.1 million this year against $464,000 for the same period last year - a sharp rise of $636,000.

Neuron Mobility and Telepod have become the first two firms to be dealt with in court for offences involving the public sharing of personal mobility devices (PMDs). Neuron was fined $38,000 after it was convicted of 19 charges under the Parking Places Act. Telepod was fined $16,000 after it pleaded guilty to eight similar charges. The prosecution officer for the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Mr Daniel Marini, said LTA told the public on July 4 last year that those without a licence issued by it cannot operate undocked vehicle-sharing services in public places in Singapore. Twelve days later, LTA informed Neuron about the regulations through a letter sent by registered post and via e-mail. The letter also told the company to stop providing e-scooter sharing services in public places. Its chief executive officer Wang Zi Zi confirmed that he had received the e-mail, the court heard. But between last October and this February, enforcement officers from LTA's Active Mobility Enforcement Division found 93 undocked e-scooters belonging to Neuron in public places. They were in places such as Fullerton Road, Boat Quay and outside Amoy Street Food Centre. The officers managed to hire all 93 e-scooters and the devices were impounded by LTA for investigations. Similarly, LTA informed Telepod of the regulation in May last year. The authority sent the company a letter via registered post and an e-mail about the matter on July 11 last year. Telepod's chief executive Gan Jin Ni confirmed receiving them, said Mr Marini. The enforcement officers, however, found 48 undocked Telepod e-scooters at places such as Beach Road and near Haw Par Villa MRT station from July last year to this February. In her grounds of decision, District Judge Lorraine Ho said: ""Parliament has mandated that a person is no longer authorised to provide any licensable vehicle-sharing services of PMDs, such as e-scooters, to the general public for hire and allowing the hiring of these PMDs to end in or at public places undocked. ""This is unless he or she has been granted a licence to do so or has been exempted from obtaining such a licence if such services are located within one-north, CleanTech Park or Republic Polytechnic."" Neuron and Telepod have since stopped operating here. For each charge, each company could have been fined up to $10,000. "

When the BMW and Suzuki Swift Sport were impounded by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, agencies including the Land Transport Authority learnt that both cars were not only bearing false registration plates from Malaysia, but were also deregistered in Singapore and exported to Malaysia. They also found a Malaysian driving licence with Zhang Weida's name in the BMW. Digging deeper, it emerged that the Singaporean had bribed a contact across the Causeway to obtain the genuine Malaysian driving licence. Zhang did not have a valid Singapore driving licence. The 35-year-old was yesterday sentenced to seven months and 22 weeks' jail on 30 counts in total of corruption, forgery and traffic-related offences. He was also slapped with a $7,300 fine and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for three years after pleading guilty last month. The court heard that Zhang had obtained the licence some time in 2009 by giving a bribe of RM7,000 (S$2,300) to a contact in Malaysia to benefit a government official there. The official was not named in court documents. Zhang claimed he was introduced to this unidentified middleman by a friend in Kuala Lumpur, who gave him a number to call. Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Chew said: ""The contact allegedly knew someone from Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan Malaysia - the Road Transport Department of Malaysia. ""The accused understood this to mean that the unknown contact would bribe an unknown Malaysian government official to obtain the said driving licence without the accused having to take any driving test."" In May 2017, Zhang went to Malaysia to buy a BMW and in April last year, he bought a Suzuki Swift Sport from a Malaysian car dealer. Singaporeans and permanent residents of Singapore are not allowed to drive foreign-registered vehicles into Singapore. But Zhang later drove both cars here. He started incurring parking fines for both cars, but did not pay them. The vehicles were impounded in May last year. As a result of his action, a Malaysian motorist was denied entry into Singapore last September for traffic offences she did not commit. This was because her car bore the genuine licence plate number unlawfully displayed on the Suzuki. The woman, identified only as Ms Wong, had to lodge a police report, the court heard. It was not stated if she made the report here or in Malaysia. "

The two suspects, who are the biological parents of the dead toddler, have been remanded since June 2018 for other unrelated offences. The mother is understood to have been sentenced earlier this month to a jail term of five years and two months for drug-related offences.

Neuron Mobility and Telepod have become the first two firms to be dealt with in court for offences involving the public sharing of personal mobility devices (PMDs). Neuron was fined $38,000 after it was convicted of 19 charges under the Parking Places Act. Telepod was fined $16,000 after it pleaded guilty to eight similar charges. Land Transport Authority (LTA) prosecution officer Daniel Marini said the authority told the public on July 4 last year that those without a licence issued by it cannot operate undocked vehicle-sharing services in public places in Singapore. Twelve days later, LTA informed Neuron about the regulations through a letter sent by registered post as well as via e-mail. The letter also told the company to stop providing e-scooter sharing services in public places. Neuron chief executive officer Wang Zi Zi confirmed that he received the e-mail, the court heard. But between last October and February, enforcement officers from LTA's Active Mobility Enforcement Division found 93 undocked e-scooters belonging to Neuron in public places. They were in spots such as Fullerton Road, Boat Quay and outside Amoy Street Food Centre. The officers managed to hire all 93 e-scooters with their mobile phones and the devices were later impounded by LTA for investigations. Similarly, LTA informed Telepod of the regulation in May last year. It also sent the company a letter via registered post and an e-mail about the matter on July 11 last year. Telepod CEO Gan Jin Ni confirmed receiving them, said Mr Marini. LTA's enforcement officers, however, found 48 undocked Telepod e-scooters at places, including Beach Road and near Haw Par Villa MRT station, from July last year to February. In her grounds of decision, District Judge Lorraine Ho said: ""Parliament has mandated that a person is no longer authorised to provide any licensable vehicle-sharing services of PMDs such as e-scooters to the general public for hire and allowing the hiring of these PMDs to end in or at public places undocked. ""This is unless he or she has been granted a licence to do so or has been exempted from obtaining such a licence if such services are located within One-North, CleanTech Park or Republic Polytechnic."" Mr Marini had said that the applications for PMD-sharing licences opened only on Jan 4 this year and no licences have been issued to date. He added: ""Time was required to place necessary safeguards ensuring the maintenance, and keeping safe and roadworthy vehicles used in the licensable service. This is to ensure the safety of users and the general public."" Neuron Mobility and Telepod have since stopped operating in Singapore. For each charge, each company could have been fined up to $10,000. "

On May 18, the police received a report from a victim who said he had been cheated by a woman he had met on an online platform. The woman had asked him to make an advance payment to a bank account in exchange for sexual services. After the payment was made, the woman was no longer contactable. On Sept 12, officers from the Woodlands Police Division arrested a 22-year-old man who is believed to have masqueraded as a woman on online platforms to cheat victims. In a separate case, the police received a report of a similar cheating incident from a male victim on June 16. The victim was asked to make an advance payment to a woman's bank account in exchange for sexual services. The woman was also not contactable after the payment was made. Officers from the Woodlands Police Division identified a 34-year-old female suspect and arrested her on Sept 6. The police said that the two suspects are believed to be involved in similar cases of credit-for-sex scams islandwide. Those convicted of cheating may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The recent cases come as credit-for-sex scams in the first half of this year more than doubled, compared with the same period last year. There were 209 cases reported from January to June in 2018, but there were 456 cases reported in the first half of this year. The police said the total amount that victims were cheated increased by $636,000. Victims were cheated of $464,000 in the first half of 2018, and $1.1 million in the same period in 2019. The police remind the public to be wary of friend requests from strangers on online dating or social media platforms that offer escort, massage or sexual services. Members of the public are advised to refrain from sharing their personal details with strangers on the Internet or providing their PIN numbers or serial codes of online shopping credits with strangers online.

Mendel See Li Quan, who is now 19, pleaded guilty to one charge each of raping and robbing the 53-year-old victim on Oct 2, 2017, and a third charge of stealing $670 from another victim in September 2017. Eight other charges were taken into consideration by the court. In sentencing, Justice Valerie Thean said the need for rehabilitation was displaced by the violence and brutality shown by See, who wielded a chopper against the victim. See's lawyer, who sought reformative training, said he was appealing against the sentence. Bail was doubled to $100,000 pending appeal. The court heard that See, a Malaysian, got to know Singaporeans Benjamin Yong Dun Zheng and his girlfriend Chow Chia Suan, both 23, in 2017. The trio discussed possible ways to make money and See, a Singapore permanent resident, proposed robbing prostitutes. In some cases, either Yong or See would engage the services of the prostitute and the others would steal from the victim's bag while she was in the bathroom. On other occasions, the trio would stage an act while the prostitute was at Yong or See's home. The other two would show up pretending to be loan sharks and would then rob the victim to pay her customer's ""debt"". On Oct 1, 2017, See contacted the 53-year-old victim, a freelance sex worker, who then asked a Filipina to meet him at his condominium at Canberra Drive in Yishun. See became angry when the Filipina failed to turn up and decided to ""take revenge"" on the victim. The next day, he contacted the victim, offering her $900 for her services. Arrangements were made for her to go to Yong's Yishun flat that night. After she arrived, on Yong's signal, See and Chow banged on the main door. After entering the bedroom, the two made a show of threatening Yong for payment. See then pulled the victim's bag away from her, pointing a chopper at her and shouting at her not to move. Chow rifled through the bag and took two mobile phones and $100 in cash. The victim told See she wanted to go home but he told her to take off all her clothes. When she replied that there were many people in the room, See told Chow and Yong to go outside. See then demanded sex while holding the chopper, and the victim did as she was told. The couple did not know what he did in the room. The victim later left the flat without her valuables and called the police after she reached home. The trio spent the money that night on food, transport and games at an Internet gaming shop. On Monday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong sought nine years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane. She argued that despite his age, See was viewed by his accomplices as a peer; the fact that his accomplices complied with his order to leave the room showed he was ""clearly no follower"". See's lawyer, Mr Siraj Shaik Aziz, assigned under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, argued for him to be sent for reformative training. In letters submitted to the court, See said he regretted mixing with bad company, while his parents blamed themselves for being too occupied with work in Malaysia and not spending enough time with him. See said his dream was to be a pilot. ""However, I am afraid that because of my mistake and the punishment I receive will result in me losing the opportunity to pursue my dream,"" he wrote. Yong and Chow pleaded guilty to one charge each of robbery, cheating and theft in January this year. Yong was sentenced to 3½ years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Chow was sentenced to four years' jail. "

When the BMW and Suzuki Swift Sport were impounded by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, agencies including the Land Transport Authority learnt that both cars not only were bearing false registration plates from Malaysia, but were also actually cars that were deregistered in Singapore and exported to Malaysia. They also found a Malaysian driving licence with Zhang Weida's name in the BMW. Digging deeper, it emerged that the Singaporean had bribed a contact across the Causeway to obtain the genuine Malaysian driving licence. Zhang did not have a valid Singapore driving licence. On Monday (Sept 16), the 35-year-old was sentenced to seven months and 22 weeks' jail on 30 counts in total of corruption, forgery and traffic-related offences. He was also slapped with a $7,300 fine and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for three years after pleading guilty last month. The court heard that Zhang had obtained the licence sometime in 2009 by giving a bribe of RM7,000 to a contact in Malaysia to benefit a government official there. The official was not named in court documents. Zhang gave the money by transferring it from Singapore via Western Union.  He claimed he was introduced to this unidentified middleman by a friend in Kuala Lumpur who gave him a number to call. Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Chew said: ""The contact allegedly knew someone from Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan Malaysia - the Road Transport Department of Malaysia. ""The accused understood this to mean that the unknown contact would bribe an unknown Malaysian government official to obtain the said driving licence without the accused having to take any driving test."" In May 2017, he went to Malaysia to buy a BMW and in April last year, he bought a Suzuki Swift Sport from a Malaysian car dealer. Singaporeans and permanents residents of Singapore are not allowed to drive a foreign-registered vehicle into Singapore. But Zhang later drove both cars here. He started incurring parking fines for both cars but did not pay them. The vehicles were impounded in May last year. As a result of his action, a Malaysian motorist was denied entry into Singapore last September for traffic offences she did not commit. This was because her car bore the genuine licence plate number unlawfully displayed on the Suzuki. The woman, identified only as Ms Wong, had to lodge a police report, the court heard. It was not stated if she made the report here or in Malaysia. The DPP said: ""The accused had caused inconvenience and anxiety to... Ms Wong, as she had to prove her innocence to the relevant authorities for the offences committed by the accused who was in possession of the vehicle with the false licence plate."" Offenders convicted of corruption can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000. "

Those arrested include seven teenagers - aged between 13 and 18 - caught at a drug party in Fajar Road, as well as a couple with four children under the age of seven, the CNB added. A total of 124g of heroin, 91g of methamphetamine or Ice, 15g of new psychoactive substances, 8g of ketamine, three Ecstasy tablets, three Erimin-5 tablets, three bottles containing methadone and two LSD stamps - a hallucinogenic drug - were seized. The operation took place from the morning of Sept 2 until yesterday morning, and covered areas including Geylang, Serangoon, Toa Payoh and Woodlands. CNB said it raided a ninth-floor residential unit at Block 454 Fajar Road, where a drug party was in full swing, on Wednesday. Despite repeated warnings, the occupants refused to give officers access to the unit, with two occupants climbing out of the unit and onto the air-conditioner ledge to evade arrest. They also threw a small packet of Ice, a cut straw, two syringes, three lighters and a lighter refiller out the window and onto the grass patch below the block. These were later recovered by CNB. Seven teenagers between 13 and 18 years of age and a 38-year-old Singaporean woman were arrested. Preliminary investigations showed that the woman was the biological mother of two of the teens - a 16-year-old girl and her 13-year-old brother. In another case on Sept 2, CNB arrested a Singaporean couple - a 33-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman - near Edgefield Walk after 5g of Ice and drug paraphernalia were found in their unit. Three of their four children - aged three months, 19 months and six years - were in the unit during the raid. The eldest, who is six years and nine months old, was in school. CNB said it is working closely with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to care for the children, who will be looked after by extended family members.

Dr Damian Yeo Eng Hui, 32, a resident at the emergency medicine department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), was also ordered to attend drug rehabilitation sessions. Dr Yeo was sanctioned by a disciplinary tribunal for bringing disrepute to the medical profession through his misconduct. The tribunal's grounds of decision, published this week, show that the case could be the first time such a sanction under the Medical Registration Act was considered. Dr Yeo was a senior resident physician at TTSH when he was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau on Aug 1, 2017. He had consumed methamphetamine, commonly known as Ice, and was also in possession of 2.69g of Ice, three tablets of the sedative Nimetazepam and drug-taking utensils, namely, a lighter, cut straws and a syringe. He was sent to the drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) on Aug 8, 2017 for his drug consumption offence, and given a stern warning for the other offences.

In disciplinary proceedings brought by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC), Dr Yeo pleaded guilty on May 8 this year to a charge of improper conduct that brings disrepute to the profession. The SMC argued that he should be downgraded from a fully registered doctor to one with conditions and restrictions within a supervisory framework of two years. Drug offences are ""extremely serious"", and Dr Yeo was arrested for not just one, but multiple offences, the SMC argued. Dr Yeo's lawyer argued that a censure was sufficient, citing two precedents involving doctors who were convicted and jailed for drug offences. The lawyer also said that Dr Yeo had committed the offences in a moment of folly owing to the pressures of work, and has made good progress in his rehabilitation regime. Dr Yeo said under oath that he was off duty on the day of his arrest and the day before. After considering the arguments, the tribunal ordered that Dr Yeo's status be downgraded for 18 months, during which he also has to attend regular sessions with an approved addictions specialist. ""(As the respondent is) a doctor practising emergency medicine in a major hospital, the professional competence of the respondent in treating and not doing harm to patients would be placed in question upon his arrest for possessing and consuming illicit drugs,"" said the tribunal. A censure, being a formal statement of disapproval, was wholly inadequate to send the message that such misconduct will not be condoned, it added. The tribunal said rehabilitation was appropriate, given that Dr Yeo is young, has a promising career ahead of him and appears to have the support of his colleagues and superiors. This was in line with the present focus on rehabilitating drug offenders, said the tribunal, citing recent changes to the law to channel ""pure abusers"" to the DRC instead of sending them to jail. As for the precedents cited by the lawyer, the tribunal said the doctors in those cases were convicted of drug possession, not consumption.

The text messages were revealed in court yesterday during the cross-examination of prosecution witness Liu Xiayu, who was the subordinate of Arianto Tjandra at subcontractor CPG Consultants at the time. Mr Liu had joined CPG in 2010, but resigned in February last year. Arianto Tjandra, 46, was the qualified person from CPG who had approved the design and supervised the construction works for the project. He is facing five charges under the Building Control Act and the Workplace Safety and Health Act. The viaduct collapsed in the early hours of July 14, 2017, resulting in the death of 31-year-old Chinese worker Chen Yinchuan. Ten other workers were hurt, two seriously. Yesterday, the court heard that about five hours after the incident, Mr Liu had messaged Arianto Tjandra, saying that he felt ""so sorry about the accident"". ""Please let me know if I can help (with) something,"" he added in the text message. WhatsApp messages between engineer Robert Arianto Tjandra (AT) and his subordinate Liu Xiayu (Liu) on July 14, 2017, the day of the In response, Arianto Tjandra asked Mr Liu to check calculations for piers 40 and 41 - vertical columns on which the viaduct would have rested. After making the calculations, Mr Liu told Arianto Tjandra that the support structures had not been designed to sufficiently support the weight of the viaduct. In response, Arianto Tjandra said to Mr Liu: ""Then no deck slab can be cast?"" Mr Liu replied: ""Yes. Not allowed deck slab."" Deck slab refers to the slab of concrete that would have acted as the carriageway for vehicles on the viaduct. ""Die. My prop also failed,"" Arianto Tjandra said, referring to the temporary structures to support the weight of the viaduct that was under construction. Subsequent WhatsApp messages between the men also revealed that after the collapse, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) had questioned CPG's design for parts of the viaduct, including piers 40 and 41. In one message, Arianto Tjandra told Mr Liu: ""LTA boss already questioned our design for flyover 7 and 8. The design not consistent. Some piers heavily reinforced, some are not."" Mr Liu responded: ""We try to explain. That's why we use propping. Anyhow, I may not know the full story. But let me know if you need help at any time. I am also responsible for it."" When defence lawyer Tay Peng Cheng from WongPartnership, acting for Or Kim Peow Contractors (OKP), asked Mr Liu if he had meant in the message that the PIE viaduct collapse was due to design inadequacies, Mr Liu said: ""Correct."" In July, OKP was fined $10,000 for carrying out unauthorised strengthening works on the permanent corbels - support structures - of the PIE viaduct. Its group managing director Or Toh Wat was also given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for all three of his charges under the Building Control Act and the Workplace Safety and Health Act. However, OKP still faces one remaining charge for causing the death of Mr Chen Yinchuan and the injuries of 10 others under the Workplace Safety and Health Act - which it is contesting in this trial. Besides Arianto Tjandra, two other individuals allegedly linked to the incident - both OKP employees - are involved in the trial: project engineer Wong Kiew Hai, 31, and project director Allen Yee, 49.

As he did not want his wife to worry, Briton David Andrew Hygate decided to forge various e-mails purportedly sent by the Visitor Services Centre of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to his personal e-mail account. He then forwarded these e-mails to his wife, Mrs Marilou Cambo Hygate, 39, to dupe her into believing that her LTVP had been extended by ICA. Besides these, Hygate also forged e-mails purportedly sent by Drew and Napier law firm to buttress the deception so that she would not question him about the status of her pass. Former pharmacologist Hygate, 51, was sentenced on Friday (Sept 13) to 14 weeks' jail and a fine of $2,000 after he pleaded guilty to one count of abetting his wife's overstaying. The fine was imposed for he cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old. He was also fined an additional $6,000 after admitting to two forgery charges. Another six forgery charges and one count of knowingly harbouring an immigration offender were considered during sentencing. The court heard that Mrs Hygate has already served her 16-week sentence after unlawfully remaining in Singapore for nearly three years - from Sept 27, 2015, to Aug 20 last year. She is now back in the Philippines. Deputy Public Prosecutor Foong Leong Parn said the Briton has been a Singapore permanent resident since June 11, 2009. Court documents did not reveal when or where he married his wife, but the couple relocated to Singapore in February 2014. He then applied for her LTVP and was aware that it would expire in September 2015. However, Hygate later became unemployed and forged the e-mails as he did not want his wife to worry. The offences came to light on Aug 20 last year when ICA officers conducted a check at the couple's home and Mrs Hygate produced her passport for verification. Officers then found out that her LTVP had expired on Sept 26, 2015. The DPP told District Judge John Ng: ""According to ICA's records, there were no further extensions or applications made to renew Marilou's LTVP after its expiry. As such, Marilou was established to be an immigration offender. Consequently, both the accused and Marilou were referred to the ICA Enforcement Division for further investigations."" Officers later found the forged e-mails, purportedly from ICA, on her mobile phone. Hygate, who was unrepresented, told Judge Ng on Friday that he committed the offences out of desperation as he did not want to be away from his wife. He added that he had acted ""out of character"" when he sent the ""stupid e-mails"". Hygate also said he intends to cancel his permanent residency and leave the country to be with his family. For each count of forgery, he could have been jailed for up to four years and fined. "

Mr Liu joined CPG in 2010, but resigned in Feburary 2018. Arianto Tjandra, 46, was the qualified person from CPG who had approved the design and supervised the construction works for the project. He is facing five charges under the Building Control Act and the Workplace Safety and Health Act. The viaduct collapsed in the early hours of July 14, 2017, resulting in the death of 31-year-old Chinese worker Chen Yinchuan. Ten other workers were hurt, two seriously. On Friday, the court heard that about five hours after the incident, Mr Liu messaged Arianto Tjandra, saying that he felt ""so sorry about the accident"". ""Please let me know if I can help (with) something,"" he added in the text message. In response, Arianto Tjandra asked Mr Liu to check calculations for piers 40 and 41 - vertical columns on which the viaduct would have rested. After making the calculations, Mr Liu told Arianto Tjandra that the support structures had not been sufficiently designed to support the weight of the viaduct. In response, Arianto Tjandra said to Mr Liu: ""Then no deck slab can be cast?"" Mr Liu replied: ""Yes. Not allowed deck slab."" Deck slab refers to the slab of concrete that would have acted as the carriageway for vehicles on the viaduct. ""Die. My prop also failed,"" Arianto Tjandra had said to Mr Liu, referring to the temporary structures to support the weight of the viaduct that was under construction. Referring to the text messages, defence lawyer Tay Peng Cheng from WongPartnership, acting for Or Kim Peow Contractors (OKP), asked Mr Liu whether he believed Arianto Tjandra had made similar calculations relating to the support structures before giving OKP the instructions to construct the deck slab. Mr Liu said he was not aware, as he did not know details of the discussion between Arianto Tjandra and Mr William Wang, another member of the CPG design engineering team for the project. When pressed by Mr Tay on whether he knew if any discussions took place between Arianto and Mr Wang, Mr Liu said: ""I couldn't answer this. But I guess there must be some discussion."" Subsequent WhatsApp messages between Arianto Tjandra and Mr Liu also revealed that after the collapse, the Land Transport Authority questioned CPG's design for parts of the viaduct, including piers 40 and 41. In one message, Arianto Tjandra told Mr Liu: ""LTA boss already questioned our design for flyover 7 & 8. The design not consistent. Some piers heavily reinforced, some are not."" Mr Liu responded: ""We try to explain. That's why we use propping. Anyhow, I may not know the full story. But let me know if you need help at anytime. I am also responsible for it."" When Mr Tay asked Mr Liu if he had meant in the WhatsApp message that the PIE viaduct collapse was due to design inadequacies, Mr Liu said: ""Correct."" Earlier this year, in July, OKP was  Its group managing director Or Toh Wat was also given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for all his three charges. These were two charges under the Building Control Act, in relation to carrying out unauthorised works, and another charge of failing to ensure the safety and health of his employees under the Workplace Safety and Health Act. However, OKP still faces one remaining charge for causing the death of a Chinese worker and the injuries of 10 others under the Workplace Safety and Health Act - which it is contesting in this trial. Besides Arianto Tjandra, two other individuals allegedly linked to the incident are also involved in the trial: OKP project engineer Wong Kiew Hai, 31, and OKP project director Allen Yee Chee Keong, 49.

Those arrested include seven teenagers - aged between 13 and 18 - caught at a drug party in Fajar Road, as well as a couple with four children under the age of seven, the CNB added. A total of 124g of heroin, 91g of Ice, 15g of new psychoactive substances, 8g of ketamine, three Ecstasy tablets, three Erimin-5 tablets, three bottles containing methadone and two LSD stamps - a hallucinogenic drug - were seized. The operation took place from the morning of Sept 2 to Friday morning, covering areas including Geylang, Serangoon, Toa Payoh and Woodlands. CNB said it raided a ninth-floor residential unit at Block 454 Fajar Road, where a drug party was in full swing, on Wednesday. Despite repeated warnings, the occupants refused to give officers access to the unit, with two occupants climbing out of the unit onto the air-conditioner ledge to evade arrest. They also threw a small packet of Ice, a cut straw, two syringes, three lighters and a lighter refiller out the window onto the grass patch below the block. These were later recovered by CNB. Seven teenagers between 13 and 18 years of age, and a 38-year-old Singaporean woman were arrested. Preliminary investigations showed that the woman was the biological mother of two of the teens - a 16-year-old girl and her 13-year-old brother. In another case on Sept 2, CNB arrested a Singaporean couple - a 33-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman - near Edgefield Walk after 5g of Ice and drug paraphernalia were found in their unit. Three of their four children - aged three months, 19 months and six years - were in the unit during the CNB raid. The eldest, aged six years and nine months, was in school. CNB said it is working closely with the Ministry of Social and Family Development to care for the children, who will be looked after by extended family members. The agency is investigating the drug activities of the arrested suspects. "

Together, they made 14 successful bogus claims. Lau pleaded guilty last month to two offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. She also admitted to one count each of cheating and falsification of accounts. Liu, 55, was the sole director of Derma Flora Beauty Academy and Derma Flora Beauty. She was also the sole proprietor of Beaux Ex Bellus Trading. Collectively, these firms were known as the Derma Flora Group. Lau, who worked for Derma Flora Beauty Academy and Derma Flora Beauty, resigned in October 2013. Liu's cases are still pending. The two companies were training providers, conducting beauty and body treatment courses that had been approved under WDA's Funding for Employer-based Training Scheme. The initiative aimed to encourage employers to upgrade their workers' skills by defraying their costs in doing so. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew said that Derma Flora Beauty and Beaux Ex Bellus Trading were ""applicant companies"" that had also applied for WDA funding under the scheme. These firms could apply for training grants to fund their employees' participation in courses run by approved training providers. DPP Yew said that between December 2011 and July 2013, Lau acted on Liu's instructions and accessed SkillsConnect - an online portal hosted on WDA's server - to submit false information to the agency. WDA was, among other things, told that trainees sent for courses by Derma Flora Beauty and Beaux Ex Bellus Trading were employees of the two firms, but there were, in fact, no such workers. As a result, 14 successful fraudulent claims were made totalling more than $64,000. The DPP told District Judge Kessler Soh: ""Lau was never intended to receive any direct financial benefit nor did she receive any direct financial benefit from her participation in the scams."" The offences came to light in July 2013 when WDA conducted an audit on the Derma Flora Group. Lau then contacted the agency and the Committee for Private Education later that year, telling them about some fraudulent attendance records. On April 1, 2014, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received a complaint from WDA against the Derma Flora Group about the fraudulent training grant claims. Lau came clean about what she had done during CAD's investigations. For falsifying accounts, offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

The High Court last year had refused to allow the witness, Mr Tejinder Singh Sekhon, to testify from Australia via video link, but the Court of Appeal overruled it after hearing the case last month. Australian national Tejinder was prepared to testify as a witness for Singaporean Anil Singh Gurm in a lawsuit here over alleged negligence in relation to the legality of buying a semi-detached house in Serangoon Gardens. But he feared returning to Singapore might lead to prosecution over the same property purchase. As a foreigner, Mr Tejinder could not buy the house in his own name, so he had Anil do it. But Mr Tejinder paid all the outlays, and lived there from 2007 to 2011 before selling the house and returning to Australia. A check showed the house is now worth some $5 million. In January 2015, Anil was charged with buying a property as a nominee for a foreigner with the intention to hold it in trust for the foreigner. This is prohibited unless approval is obtained. Anil then sued the law firm and a lawyer in the firm, which had advised him on the property purchase. He now wants Mr Tejinder as his witness for the civil suit. The High Court in its decision last year recognised the novel question of law posed by the video-link application and had allowed leave to Anil to appeal against the matter as it would be to ""public advantage"" for the top court to address the important issue raised. At last month's Court of Appeal hearing, his lawyers Deborah Barker and Ushan Premaratne urged the court to focus on the prejudice suffered by the parties if the video-link testimony were not allowed, arguing the relevant section of the Evidence Act should be interpreted widely to achieve the purpose of the Act. Lawyers Chandra Mohan and Ang Tze Phern for the respondents countered, among other things, that the giving of evidence via video link is the exception rather than the rule and a witness who desires not to return to Singapore solely to avoid prosecution here is merely ""unwilling"", and not ""unable"", to give evidence in Singapore. They added that the evidence Mr Tejinder proposed to give via video link would potentially serve to exonerate him from the offence he was seeking to avoid being charged with. The Court of Appeal, comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang and Judith Prakash, in allowing the appeal, accepted that a purposive interpretation should be given to the provisions under the Evidence Act permitting video-link evidence. The court will issue its full decision grounds in due course. Senior Counsel Barker said when contacted yesterday that the case is ground-breaking as the appeal court considered the principles to be applied when deciding whether to grant leave for a foreign witness to give evidence by video link. ""The court found the fact that the witness was unwilling to come to Singapore due to a fear of prosecution was not a bar to allowing him to give evidence by VL (video link),"" she said. ""The Court of Appeal concluded that concerns whether such a move would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were outweighed by the public interest in access to justice, namely, that a litigant should be allowed to bring before the court evidence critical to his case."" The court ordered $36,000 in costs be paid to Anil in relation to the High Court hearing last year and this Court of Appeal hearing. The negligence suit by Anil is ongoing. Mr Tejinder is now cleared to testify by video link at a date to be fixed. "

But all that bravado faded for one of them in court yesterday. As Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua was addressing the court on sentencing matters following the incident, which left a 44-year-old auxiliary police officer with an eye injury that is most likely permanent, one of two 17-year-old boys standing before the judge suddenly fell back in his seat in the dock. A woman, believed to be his mother, went up to him and massaged his head to give him some comfort as the other boy looked on. After five minutes, court proceedings continued. District Judge Eddy Tham then sentenced each of them to a year's reformative training. This means the teenagers will be detained in a reformative training centre to follow a strict regimen that includes foot drills and counselling. The judge said that they had taken part in ""causing havoc without any care or regard to anyone else"" and stressed that those who behaved in such a manner must be ""punished severely"". The boys are the first two to be sentenced over the incident. They each pleaded guilty last month to a rioting charge and two counts of vandalism. The rioters cannot be named owing to a gag order. A third 17-year-old youth, who also pleaded guilty to similar charges last month, was arrested on Wednesday over alleged drug-related offences. His case has been adjourned to Oct 10. The court heard that the trio were sent to the home in Jurong West after they committed offences, including theft. Besides the injured auxiliary police officer, the riot also left a 33-year-old youth guidance officer and the home's 45-year-old assistant manager with head injuries. The riot happened at around 5.50pm on Sept 28 last year after the youth guidance officer called for everyone to fall in at the home's courtyard. One of the trio and a 15-year-old boy started a fake argument which led to a fight. When the officer tried to separate them, the 15-year-old punched the man's face, and the other teens, including the trio, joined in the attack. The assistant manager and the auxiliary police officer, who tried to help the man, were also attacked by the teens. One of them - the teenager who was comforted by his mother in court - then used a floorball stick to hit the assistant manager in the back of his head. The boy arrested on Wednesday struck the auxiliary police officer's head with a similar stick multiple times. The injured adults eventually fled the scene. The trio and the other rioters also took turns to damage property at the home. The cases involving the other rioters are still pending. "

The women, aged 26 and 60, are believed to have used the card to spend more than $1,500 on various goods, such as clothes, toiletries, handbags, healthcare products, a pair of spectacles and two stored-value cards. Preliminary investigations showed that the 26-year-old woman is believed to have picked up the victim's credit card and made the unauthorised transactions with the 60-year-old woman, the police said in a statement yesterday. The women are expected to be charged in court today. The man whose credit card was used by the two women made a police report about his lost card and how several unauthorised transactions, amounting to more than $1,500, were made on it. Anyone found guilty of dishonest misappropriation of property can be fined, jailed for up to two years, or both. A person found guilty of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The police advised members of the public to be vigilant of their surroundings and to keep their belongings safe in public. ""Merchants and sales staff are advised to exercise vigilance and adopt correct card-acceptance procedures when processing credit or debit card transactions,"" they added. Staff should look out for the name and security features on the card and immediately contact the relevant banks for advice if they detect anything suspicious. The police also advised credit and debit card holders to call their banks immediately if their cards are lost or stolen. To prevent unauthorised use of their cards, consumers can opt for an SMS notification to be sent to their mobile phones for any charges incurred on their credit or debit cards. They can also check bank statements and alert the bank immediately if there are discrepancies or fraudulent charges, as well as refrain from giving their card details to strangers. "

The man, who is married with no children, pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated molestation on Tuesday, with two charges of showing obscene objects to the victim taken into consideration. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim described the man's actions against the young victim as wicked, premeditated and an abuse of trust. There was great trust between the family of the man's wife and the victim's family, who have been next-door neighbours since the 1980s, and this trust extended to the man when he moved in with his wife's family, said the DPP. The DPP argued that showing obscene images to the girl was an ""overt act of sexual grooming"". He sought five years' jail and nine strokes of the cane. ""His acts of lust would leave an indelible mark on the life of a young innocent child, and destroyed the close, almost three-decade friendship shared between two families."" Defence counsel Peter Fernando conceded that it was an aggravating factor to show obscene images to the girl, but he argued that it was a gross exaggeration to say it was tantamount to sexual grooming. Mr Fernando said the victim had, on multiple occasions, on her own accord and in privacy, viewed sexual content using her father's laptop. There was no evidence that his client had taught her how to download sexual content, said the lawyer. He said there was no trauma to the victim arising from the offences. The lawyer added that his client has sought spiritual guidance and volunteers regularly in church with his ""extremely supportive"" wife. He sought a two-year jail term and added that his client and his wife are sorry for what he did to the victim. In sentencing, Justice Pang Khang Chau noted the very young age of the victim and that there was abuse of trust given the close relationship between the two families. The judge agreed with the prosecution that the acts were premeditated rather than opportunistic, as argued by the defence. The first incident took place on Sept 4, 2017, after the man went over to the victim's house to help her father fix the water heater. The man left the house but returned - after her father had left for work - and went up to the second floor, where the girl was in her parents' bedroom. He showed her an obscene photo and video on his mobile phone, then touched her inappropriately. She pushed him out the door and tried to shut it, but relented after he begged her. He entered the room again and pulled down her underwear. On Dec 1, 2017, the man left for his workplace, Marina Bay Sands (MBS), with his wife on his motorcycle. The court heard that he had lied to his wife that he had some work to do, and at the same time, arranged with the girl to go to her house. Leaving his wife to shop at MBS, he went to the victim's house and used a gate key entrusted to his in-laws to enter the house. He touched her again. Over the next three days, the girl told her mother to get the key back from the neighbours and what the man had done. Her mother eventually confronted the man on Dec 6 and a police report was made.

The two men - Mr Aaron Prem Michael, 25, and Mr Chioh Hong Heng, 43 - were friends of the driver, Joseph Low Moh Boon, 25. They were out earlier that night celebrating Low's birthday. Low pleaded guilty yesterday to causing the death of his friends by driving in a rash manner. The court heard that after completing his last delivery on Oct 19 last year, Low headed back home in the direction of Woodlands and picked Mr Chioh up on the way at around 10.30pm. While Low took a shower, Mr Chioh went to meet Mr Michael, who lived nearby. The delivery driver initially told Mr Chioh he did not wish to go out as he was tired but the older man insisted as it was Low's birthday the next day. The trio then went to a pub in Jalan Besar where they ordered three jugs of beer. Low admitted to drinking the alcoholic beverage. The three men left the pub together early the next morning and eyewitnesses later spotted Low's van speeding along Bukit Timah Road. At around 3am, it crashed into a tree, killing Mr Chioh and Mr Michael. ""At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, traffic flow was light and visibility was clear,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Foong Leong Parn, presenting video evidence of Low's van drifting at a high speed down the road, and then crashing. The Health Sciences Authority estimated that before the accident, Low had been driving at speeds of up to 122kmh - double the speed limit on the road. DPP Foong said that Low had a history of speeding, with his last violation in Jan 24 last year. That was less than 10 months before the fatal crash. Additionally, a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and various drugs in Low's urine and blood samples, including the illegal narcotic ketamine. The DPP said: ""It is abundantly clear that the accused's rash act in the present case was not a momentary misjudgment. ""In fact, the accused's driving was a prolonged and deliberate course of reckless driving, starting from the time when he was already feeling tired even before meeting his friends and yet choosing to drive, driving while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and speeding right up to the point of the collision."" She urged the court to sentence Low to two years' jail and disqualify him from driving all classes of vehicles for 12 years. The case has been adjourned to Sept 30 for a hearing to determine if Low was under the influence of drugs before the crash. For causing the men's deaths by rash driving, Low can be jailed for up to five years and fined. "

Myanmar national Lain Ngain, 28, was sentenced on Wednesday to four months in jail for voluntarily causing hurt to Madam Wee Keu Hoi. Lain Ngain started working in Madam Wee's home in September 2017 and was tasked to take care of the older woman, who was bedridden and in ill health from July 5 last year until her death on Jan 23 this year from a heart attack. Lain Ngain had to look after Madam Wee's daily needs, including feeding her, changing her clothes and bathing her. In December last year, Madam Wee was hospitalised at NUH. Madam Wee's son - Mr Choo Wee Seng, 41 - told Lain Ngain to attend to his mother's needs at the hospital ward during visiting hours. On the afternoon of Dec 31, Madam Wee told her son that the maid had hit her on several occasions, including when Lain Ngain visited her earlier at around 11am. Mr Choo lodged a police report two days later, stating: ""My mum is critically ill and unable to fight back. The maid abused my mum by pinching her left breast and causing bruises, and she also spat on my mum's face."" Investigations by the authorities confirmed that Lain Ngain was captured on closed-circuit television pinching Madam Wee's left breast, left arm, left cheek and nose. The maid claimed that Madam Wee had thrown tantrums and insulted her on several occasions when she was taking care of her at the ward. This led her to pinch Madam Wee in an attempt to stop the older woman from throwing any further tantrums. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng told the court that the case involved an ""utter betrayal of the trust"" placed in Lain Ngain to care for the elderly and terminally ill victim. ""The accused was callous and cruel towards the victim, who had to suffer at the hands of her abuser even during the last few weeks towards the end of her life,"" said DPP Ng. ""Instead of caring for the victim, the accused took advantage of the trust placed in her and hurt the very person she was tasked to care for, while the victim was helpless and defenceless against her assaults,"" he added. DPP Ng also urged the court to send a strong signal to deter caregivers from abusing the trust placed in them to look after the vulnerable and elderly. For voluntarily causing hurt, Lain Ngain could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. "

Scammers contacted the victims on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, impersonating the victims' friends or followers.

The man whose credit card was used by the two women made a police report about his lost card and how several unauthorised transactions, amounting to more than $1,500, were made on it. Anyone found guilty of dishonest misappropriation of property can be fined, jailed for up to two years, or both. A person found guilty of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The police advised members of the public to be vigilant of their surroundings and to keep their belongings safe in public. ""Merchants and sales staff are advised to exercise vigilance and adopt correct card acceptance procedures when processing credit or debit card transactions,"" they added. Staff should look out for the name and security features on the card face and immediately contact the relevant banks for advice if they detect anything suspicious. The police also advised credit and debit cardholders to call their banks immediately if their cards are lost or stolen. To prevent unauthorised use of their cards, people can opt for an SMS notification to be sent to their mobile phones for any charges incurred on their credit or debit cards. They can also check bank statements and alert the bank immediately if there are discrepancies or fraudulent charges, as well as refrain from giving their card details to strangers. "

On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim described the man's actions against the young victim as wicked, premeditated and an abuse of trust. There was great trust between the family of the man's wife and the victim's family, who have been next-door neighbours since the 1980s, and this trust extended to the man when he moved in with his wife's family, said the DPP. The DPP argued that showing obscene images to the girl was an ""overt act of sexual grooming by desensitising the victim to sexual activity through inappropriate exposure to sexual content"". He sought five years' jail and nine strokes of the cane. ""His acts of lust would leave an indelible mark on the life of a young innocent child, and destroyed the close, almost three-decade friendship shared between the two families."" Defence counsel Peter Fernando conceded that it was an aggravating factor to show obscene images to the girl, but he argued that it was a gross exaggeration to say it was tantamount to sexual grooming. Mr Fernando said the victim had, on multiple occasions, on her own accord and in privacy, viewed obscene sexual content using her father's laptop. There was no evidence that his client had taught her how to download sexual content, said the lawyer. He added that there was no psychological or physical trauma to the victim arising from the offences. The lawyer added that his client has sought spiritual guidance to turn his life around and volunteers regularly in church with his wife, who has been ""extremely supportive"". He sought a two-year jail term and added that his client and his wife are sorry to the victim and her parents for what he did. In sentencing, Justice Pang Khang Chau noted the very young age of the victim and that there was abuse of trust given the close relationship between the two families. The judge agreed with the prosecution that the acts were premeditated rather than opportunistic, as argued by the defence. This degree of premeditation was higher in the second incident, he noted, when the man arranged a meeting with the victim at her house and made efforts to lie to his wife about his whereabouts. The first incident took place on Sept 4, 2017, after the man went over to the victim's house after her father asked him to help fix the water heater. After the repairs were done, the man left the house but returned - after her father had left for work - and went up to the second floor, where the girl was using the laptop in her parents' bedroom. He showed the victim an obscene photo and video on his mobile phone, then touched her inappropriately. She pushed him out the door and tried to shut it, but relented after he begged her. He entered the room again and pulled down her underwear. On Dec 1, 2017, the man left for his workplace, Marina Bay Sands, with his wife on his motorcycle, pretending that he had to go to work. The court heard that he had lied to his wife that he had some ""packing work"" to do, and at the same time, arranged with the girl to go to her house. Leaving his wife to shop at MBS, the man went to the victim's house on his bike, and used a gate key entrusted to his in-laws to enter the house. Inside her parents' bedroom, the victim used her laptop and searched for ""sex videos"" on the Internet. They watched pornography together, before the man undressed them both, touched her and rubbed himself against her. Over the next three days, the girl told her mother to get the key back from the neighbours and that the man had come into their house, showed her an obscene video and touched her. The victim's mother eventually confronted the man on Dec 6 and a police report was made. "

Myanmar national Lain Ngain, 28, was sentenced on Wednesday (Sept 11) to four months' jail for voluntarily causing hurt to Madam Wee Keu Hoi. Lain Ngain had started working at Madam Wee's home in September 2017 and was tasked to take care of the older woman, who was bedridden and in ill health from July 5 last year until her death on Jan 23 this year from a heart attack. While Madam Wee was alive, Lain Ngain had to look after her daily needs, including feeding her, changing her clothes and helping her to bathe. In December last year, Madam Wee was hospitalised at NUH. Madam Wee's son - Mr Choo Wee Seng, 41 - told Lain Ngain to attend to his mother's needs at the hospital ward during visiting hours. In the afternoon of Dec 31, Madam Wee told her son that the maid had hit her on several occasions, including when Lain Ngain visited her earlier at around 11am. Mr Choo lodged a police report two days later stating: ""My mum is critically ill and unable to fight back. The maid abused my mum by pinching her left breast and causing bruises, and she also spat on my mum's face.""

The maid claimed that Madam Wee had thrown tantrums and also insulted her on several occasions when she was taking care of her at the ward. This led her to pinch Madam Wee in an attempt to stop the older woman from throwing any further tantrums. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng told the court that the case involved an ""utter betrayal of the trust"" placed in Lain Ngain to care for the elderly and terminally ill victim.. ""The accused was callous and cruel towards the victim, who had to suffer at the hands of her abuser even during the last few weeks towards the end of her life,"" said DPP Ng. ""Instead of caring for the victim, the accused took advantage of the trust placed in her and hurt the very person she was tasked to care for, while the victim was helpless and defenceless against her assaults,"" he added. DPP Ng also urged the court to send a strong signal to deter caregivers from abusing the trust placed in them to look after the vulnerable and elderly. For voluntarily causing hurt, Lain Ngain could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. "

Besides the injured auxiliary police officer, the riot also left a 33-year-old youth guidance officer and the home's 45-year-old assistant manager with head injuries.

The delivery driver initially told Mr Chioh that he did not wish to go out as he was tired but the older man insisted as it was Low's birthday the next day. The trio then went to a pub in Jalan Besar where they ordered three jugs of beer. Low admitted to drinking some of the alcoholic beverage. The three men left the pub together early the next morning and eyewitnesses later spotted Low's van speeding along Bukit Timah Road.

DPP Foong said that Low had a history of speeding, with his last violation in Jan 24 last year. That was less than 10 months before the fatal crash. Additionally, a toxicology report found traces of alcohol and various drugs in Low's urine and blood samples, including the illegal narcotic ketamine. The DPP said: ""It is abundantly clear that the accused's rash act in the present case was not a momentary misjudgment. ""In fact, the accused's driving was a prolonged and deliberate course of reckless driving, starting from the time when he was already feeling tired even before meeting his friends and yet choosing to drive, driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and speeding right up to the point of the collision."" She urged the court to sentence Low to two years' jail and disqualify him from driving all classes of vehicles for 12 years. The case has been adjourned to Sept 30 for a hearing to determine if Low was under the influence of drugs before the crash. For causing the men's deaths by rash driving, Low can be jailed for up to five years and fined. "

For causing grievous hurt by riding an e-scooter in a rash manner, Tan could have been jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000. And for his negligence, Tham could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. "

Two charges of showing obscene objects to the girl will be taken into consideration during sentencing, which was adjourned to tomorrow. After the 47-year-old pleaded guilty, eight other charges for offences including sexual assault by penetration, molestation and house trespass, were withdrawn. The man's name and specific job at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) were not disclosed to protect the identity of the victim, who is now 10 years old. The High Court heard that the man and the victim lived in houses next to each other, and their families have been close for years. The man lived at his wife's parents' house, while the girl lived with her parents and grandmother. As the victim's family regularly travelled overseas, her grandmother left a key to the house with the man's in-laws so that they could help collect mail, among other things. The man's wife and her parents had also helped with the victim's Primary 1 registration as her mother, a Chinese national, was not fluent in English. The girl would also regularly visit the house that the accused lived in. On the afternoon of Sept 4, 2017, the man went over to the victim's house, after her father asked for help to fix the water heater. After they were done, the girl's father, a private-hire car driver, left for work. The man, who had also left the house, returned a few minutes later and went up to the second floor, where the girl was using the laptop in her parents' bedroom. The man showed the victim an obscene photo and video on his mobile phone, then touched her. On Dec 1, 2017, the man left for MBS with his wife on his motorcycle, pretending that he had to go to work. The court heard that in the days prior, he had lied to his wife that he had some ""packing work"" to do and, at the same time, told the girl that he wanted to go to her house. While his wife shopped at MBS, the man went back to the victim's house and used the key entrusted to his in-laws to unlock the gate. He and the victim watched pornography together for a while. He touched her and rubbed himself against her as he showed her a pornographic cartoon on his phone. He then took a shower at the victim's house and returned to MBS to pick up his wife. The next day, the girl asked her mother to get the key back from the neighbours. She repeated the request over the next two days, adding that the man had come into their house, showed her an obscene video and touched her. Her mother confronted the man on Dec 6. He initially denied any wrongdoing but eventually confessed. A police report was made the next day. The man's DNA was found on the victim's underwear. "

Justice Aedit Abdullah, in judgment grounds issued on Monday, held that the case against Sulaiman Jumari had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. He found that Sulaiman had control over the room where he had been arrested and no one else would have had access to it, and the elements of the charge had been made out by the prosecution. Sulaiman had been nabbed by Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers while alone in a rented room in Lorong 39 Geylang on June 23, 2016. The drugs, contained in 22 packets, were recovered from a wardrobe, a bedside table and a bed in the room. At issue were three packets containing 49.86g of heroin inside a wardrobe drawer that did not have his DNA on them, unlike other exhibits. Sulaiman did not dispute possession of the other packets containing 2.89g of heroin recovered from the bedside table. But he claimed he did not know the three packets with 49.86g of heroin were in his room. The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount trafficked exceeds 15g. He said other people had access to the room, including on the day he was arrested, and the packets could have been placed in the wardrobe drawer without his knowledge. His defence lawyers, led by Mr Anand Nalachandran, further argued that the statement he gave at the time of his arrest should not be admitted, or it should be given minimal weight, alleging that Sulaiman had been induced to give it. But the prosecution led by Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang said Sulaiman had admitted clearly, in the statement he gave shortly after the drugs were discovered in his room, that the drugs in the three packets belonged to him, and he knew they contained heroin and were meant both for smoking and for sale. Among other things, when asked by CNB officers if he had anything to surrender as he was placed under arrest, Sulaiman said ""three"" and gestured at the wardrobe. A search revealed the three packets. The prosecution noted the drug trafficking paraphernalia found together with the quantity of drugs showed he meant to sell drugs. Justice Aedit said no evidence was presented during the 11-day trial to support Sulaiman's version that the packets had been put in the wardrobe by someone else. ""For someone to have left the (three packets) there without his knowing of it was beyond any reasonable belief,"" said the judge. He also found that Sulaiman's statement at the time of arrest was not given as a result of any inducement or any adverse conditions. Sulaiman, having been convicted, faces the death penalty unless he was a courier who had given substantive help to the authorities or was found to have mental abnormalities. ""As the accused was found to have had the drugs for sale, he did not qualify for the alternative sentencing regime, and accordingly the death sentence was passed against him,"" said Justice Aedit.

They will also be disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for three years after their release. The men, who were both driving a Volkswagen GTI, had denied that they were involved in the illegal race, which took place on Dec 9, 2016. The pair also similarly claimed trial against the charge of illegal racing, an offence under the Road Traffic Act. During the hearing, Goh said that he had been rushing to go to the toilet, while Khairulanwar claimed that he was speeding because he wanted to check his engine check-light. Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy rubbished the claims, calling them ""illogical, unsubstantiated and unbelievable"". He added: ""It is simply implausible and fanciful that (they) happened to be speeding, at almost twice the speed limit and right next to each other, at a place where a race was ongoing at the material time.""

HSA said in a statement yesterday that it had prosecuted Chong Weisheng on the same day for operating an online business in which he advertised and sold e-vaporisers. HSA inspectors raided Chong's flat in Gangsa Road in March 2015. Chong's fine is the highest penalty that has been imposed for the sale of e-vaporisers. In 2014, an offender was fined $64,500. Twenty people have been prosecuted for selling e-vaporisers, which include e-cigarettes and e-cigars, in the past five years. E-vaporisers are battery-powered devices that heat a liquid called ""vape juice"", which contains nicotine, to produce a vapour that is then inhaled. HSA's investigations showed that Chong had illegally purchased e-vaporisers from various overseas suppliers to sell them on the huntersbrew.net website. He had come across news of HSA's raids on e-vaporiser peddlers and tried to hide his illegal activities, changing the website domain name twice to avoid detection. The third website required users to have a password to access it. All sale transactions were titled ""computer IT services"" as a cover-up. In its statement, HSA reiterated that it is an offence to sell, import or distribute e-vaporisers. Anyone found guilty of doing so can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to one year or both. Since Feb 1 last year, it has also been illegal to possess, purchase or use e-vaporisers. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000. If members of the public have information on the illegal importation, distribution or sale of e-vaporisers, they can call HSA's Tobacco Regulation Branch on 6684-2036 or 6684-2037, or e-mail HSA at  More information can be found on HSA's website.

During the hearing, the 74-year-old, who argued her own case, spoke of grievances against her former husband Henry Tay, with whom she co-founded luxury watch retailer The Hour Glass. She also stressed that she was a divorced woman and was suffering from depression. Dr Tay started contempt proceedings against her after she flouted a court order that restrained her from defaming and harassing him by sending out e-mails. The recipients included ministers, employees and her grandchildren's school teachers. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her arguments, saying that two weeks' jail was ""rather lenient"", given her ""total and continued disregard for and defiance of the court's order"". Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang said that despite the fact that Chan was depressed and distressed by her problems, she knew she was in contempt by sending out the e-mails. ""It has been emphasised to her over and over again that this 'non-legal' route was in fact an unlawful one and that she should stop her destructive actions,"" said the court, which also comprised Justices Belinda Ang and Quentin Loh. ""Her recalcitrant conduct was persistent and pernicious despite the many opportunities given to her to simply stop."" After her appeal was dismissed, Chan blamed her former husband for using ""legal technicalities"" against her. ""My daughter is in jail. I'm happy to go to jail,"" she said, referring to the 22-month prison term imposed on Audrey Tay May Li, 45, for drug charges last October. Dr Tay and Chan ended their 41-year marriage in 2010. He sued her in 2014 for sending 1,265 e-mails that he said harassed him or were defamatory. The lawsuit was settled in 2016, and Chan was ordered to stop harassing and defaming Dr Tay. But she persisted in flouting the order. Dr Tay then took out contempt proceedings against her, the third time he had taken such legal action. He dropped the case the first time after she apologised, and she was fined $30,000 the second time. In 2017, the High Court sentenced Chan to two weeks' jail, but suspended the sentence for a year, on the condition that she stop flouting the order and attend monthly psychiatric sessions. She breached the conditions, resulting in the court lifting the suspension in April last year. "

She was testifying on the fifth day of the hearing in Mr Toh's suit to get back $2 million he had paid her between December 2016 and March 2017. Mr Toh, who owns three recycling companies, says the money was a loan, while Ms Jiang says it was a gift. They had both signed a loan agreement for $2 million on March 24, 2017, after Mr Toh paid her an advance of more than $1 million. He then paid her another $872,000. Ms Jiang contended that Mr Toh suggested they sign the agreement as a ploy to placate his wife, who had found out that he had given large sums of money to Ms Jiang. According to her testimony, Mr Toh had told her that Madam Chong was making things difficult for him. He had claimed that he needed the agreement to show his wife that Ms Jiang genuinely loved him and was not just after his money. Yesterday, Ms Jiang also testified that Mr Toh told her that Madam Chong was collecting evidence of an extramarital affair as the couple were going through a divorce, reported Shin Min Daily News.

Ms Jiang said Anson then took photos of the pages of her bank book and showed the transaction details to Madam Chong. Ms Jiang said she did not know that this had happened until Mr Toh and her maid told her about it. Mr Toh's lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, put it to Ms Jiang that she was making up the story, but she maintained that it was true.

Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan told the court that risk management executive Allen Vincent Hui Kim Seng, 47, was unable to move on from his former girlfriend, Ms Ng Woan Man, 30, remaining ""obsessed"" with her and stalking her ""incessantly"". The DPP added that Hui, after finding out that Ms Ng had a new lover - Mr Tan Han Shen, also 30 - took a series of calculated steps to engage a hitman-for-hire to orchestrate the younger man's murder. He told District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan: ""The accused's engagement of Camorra Hitmen to murder a stranger was not only a cold-blooded but also highly sophisticated act, which involved significant planning and premeditation, and leveraged the convenience and anonymity of the Dark Web, a platform notorious for illegal activity."" The court heard that the Dark Web contains websites that are not indexed by search engines such as Google. It is accessible only by special software, through which users and website operators can remain anonymous as well as untraceable. Defence lawyer Lee Teck Leng, who pleaded for a sentence of 21/2 years' jail, said ""no potential harm"" was caused by Hui's offence, and that Camorra Hitmen was a scam. He highlighted two articles, one of which had appeared in July last year on the website of British newspaper The Times, entitled ""Hire-a-hitman website is a scam and its owner has made a killing"". Mr Lee said the report stated: ""The website, which goes under various names including Chechen Mob, Russian Mafia and Cosa Nostra, has been linked to the arrest of a deacon in Minnesota, a businessman in Singapore and a retired family doctor from Bournemouth."" The lawyer said Hui was the ""businessman in Singapore"" referred to in the report. In response, the DPP said it was ""dangerous"" for the court to place any weight on the articles, stressing that it was not known for a fact that Camorra Hitmen was a scam. The website's name could be a reference to the Camorra, an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate. On July 17 this year, Hui, who is married and has a young daughter, pleaded guilty to one count of intentionally abetting Camorra Hitmen to kill Mr Tan. Hui had started an extramarital relationship with Ms Ng on April 22, 2016, but she ended the affair in February last year when she realised he had no intention of leaving his wife. About two months later, Ms Ng started dating Mr Tan. Consumed by jealousy, Hui went on the Camorra Hitmen website on May 6 last year and asked for Mr Tan's right hand to be cut off. He later asked for the younger man to be killed in a staged car accident and the murder was to take place on May 22 last year. But on May 12 the same year, a CBS journalist contacted the Singapore Embassy in Washington and informed it about the ""hit"". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs alerted the Singapore Police Force and officers arrested Hui five days later. He will be sentenced on Sept 18. For intentionally abetting Camorra Hitmen to kill the man, he can be jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

Ms Jiang contends that Mr Toh had suggested they sign the agreement as a ""ploy"" to placate his wife, who had found out that he gave large sums of money to Ms Jiang. According to her testimony, Mr Toh told her that his wife was making things difficult for him and he needed the agreement to show her that Ms Jiang genuinely loved him, and was not just after his money. On Monday, Ms Jiang testified that Mr Toh told her that Madam Chong was collecting evidence of an extra-marital affair as the couple were undergoing a divorce, reported Shin Min Daily News. Madam Chong then found out, with the help of one of Ms Jiang's tenants - known only as Anson - how much Mr Toh had paid Ms Jiang, she said. Under the pretext of checking whether his rent has been transferred into Ms Jiang's bank account, Anson got the maid to show him her employer's bank book, she testified. Ms Jiang said Anson then took photos of the pages of her bank book and showed the transaction details to Madam Chong. Ms Jiang said she did not know this happened until Mr Toh and her maid told her about it. Mr Toh's lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, put it to Ms Jiang that she was making up the story, but she maintained that it was true. The lawyer also produced photos of text messages that Madam Chong had taken off Mr Toh's phone. He pointed out that the messages contained promises to return the money to Mr Toh. But Ms Jiang denied sending these messages. "

She also repeatedly stressed that she was a divorced woman and was suffering from depression. Dr Tay started contempt proceedings against her in 2017 after she flouted a court order that restrained her from defaming and harassing him by sending out e-mails. The recipients included Cabinet ministers, employees and her grandchildren's school teachers. On Monday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her arguments, saying that two weeks' jail was ""rather lenient"" given her ""total and continued disregard for and defiance of the court's order"". Delivering the court's decision, Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang said that despite the fact that Chan was depressed and distressed by her problems, she knew that she was in contempt by sending out the e-mails. The court said Chan was not a helpless woman who did not know how to seek medical help or legal advice, yet she took the ""non-legal"" route to resolve her perceived problems, claiming that the e-mails were ""cries for help"" to the recipients. ""It has been emphasised to her over and over again that this 'non-legal' route was in fact an unlawful one and that she should stop her destructive actions,"" said the court, which also comprised Justices Belinda Ang and Quentin Loh. Despite this, Chan continued to breach the order with ""seeming impunity"". ""Her recalcitrant conduct was persistent and pernicious despite the many opportunities given to her to simply stop."" After her appeal was dismissed, Chan blamed her former husband for using ""legal technicalities"" against her. ""My daughter is in jail. I'm happy to go to jail,"" she said, referring to  Chan's request to defer her sentence to settle business matters was rejected. The court noted that she has been granted many adjournments in a case that has been outstanding for more than a year. Dr Tay and Chan, who have three children, ended their 41-year marriage in 2010. He sued her in 2014 for sending out 1,265 e-mails which he said harassed him or were defamatory. The lawsuit was settled in February 2016, and Chan was ordered to stop harassing and defaming Dr Tay. But she persisted in flouting the order. In February 2017, Dr Tay took out contempt proceedings against her. It was the third time he had taken such legal action. He dropped the case the first time after she apologised, and she was fined $30,000 the second time. In August 2017, the High Court sentenced Chan to two weeks' jail for contempt. But the judge gave her a last chance by suspending the sentence for a year, on condition that she stop flouting the order and attend monthly psychiatric sessions. Chan breached the first condition almost immediately by making comments on Facebook. She also failed to furnish proof of attending several sessions. Her non-compliance resulted in the High Court lifting the suspension in April last year. Chan then appealed, but the apex court upheld the High Court's decision. "

HSA said in a statement on Monday (Sept 9) that it prosecuted Chong Weisheng on the same day for operating an online business in which he advertised and sold e-vaporisers. The authority's inspectors raided Chong's flat in Gangsa Road in March 2015. Chong's fine is the highest penalty that has been imposed for the sale of e-vaporisers. In 2014, an offender was fined $64,500. Twenty people have been prosecuted for selling e-vaporisers, which include e-cigarettes and e-cigars, in the past five years. E-vaporisers are battery-powered devices that heat a liquid called ""vape juice"", which contains nicotine, to produce a vapour that is then inhaled. HSA's investigations showed that Chong had illegally purchased e-vaporisers from various overseas suppliers to sell them on the huntersbrew.net website. He had come across news of HSA's raids on e-vaporiser peddlers and tried to hide his illegal activities, changing the website domain name twice to avoid detection. The third website required its users to have a password to access it. All sale transactions were titled ""computer IT services"" as a cover-up. In its statement, HSA reminded members of the public that it is an offence to sell, import or distribute e-vaporisers. Anyone found guilty of doing so can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both. Since Feb 1, 2018, it has also been illegal to possess, purchase or use e-vaporisers. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000.

The DPP added that after finding out she had a new lover, Mr Tan Han Shen, also 30, Hui took a series of calculated steps to engage a hitman-for-hire to orchestrate the younger man's murder. He told District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan: ""The accused's engagement of Camorra Hitmen to murder a stranger was not only a cold-blooded but highly sophisticated act which involved significant planning and premeditation, and leveraged on the convenience and anonymity of the Dark Web, a platform notorious for illegal activity."" The court heard that the Dark Web contains websites that are not indexed by search engines such as Google. It is accessible only by special software where users and website operators can remain anonymous as well as untraceable. Defence lawyer Lee Teck Leng, who pleaded for a sentence of 2½ years' jail, said that ""no potential harm"" was caused by his client's offence, and that Camorra Hitmen was a scam. He highlighted two articles, one of which had appeared in July last year on British newspaper The Times' website, entitled ""Hire-a-hitman website is a scam and its owner has made a killing"". Mr Lee said the report stated: ""The website which goes under various names including Chechen Mob, Russian Mafia and Cosa Nostra has been linked to the arrest of a deacon in Minnesota, a businessman in Singapore and a retired family doctor from Bournemouth."" The lawyer said that Hui was the ""businessman in Singapore"" referred to in the report. He said the other article, entitled ""The unbelievable tale of a fake hitman, a kill list, a darknet vigilante... and a murder"", was published in Wired magazine last December. The article contained ""extensive interviews"" with a man known as Chris Monteiro, a ""British vigilante"". Mr Lee said Mr Monteiro had also provided US-based media company CBS with details about conversations from the ""hitmen website"". The lawyer said: ""CBS subsequently tipped off the police. Those tips triggered investigations and arrests, one of which was in Singapore - (and) was actually the accused's case."" In response, DPP Kumaresan said it was ""dangerous"" for the court to place any weight on the articles, stressing that it is not known for a fact that Camorra Hitmen was a scam. The website's name could be a reference to the Camorra, an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate. On July 17, Hui, who is married and has a young daughter, pleaded guilty to one count of intentionally abetting Camorra Hitmen to kill Mr Tan. Hui started an extramarital relationship with Ms Ng on April 22, 2016, but she ended the affair in February last year when she realised he had no intention of leaving his wife. About two months later, Ms Ng started dating Mr Tan. Consumed by jealousy, Hui went on the Camorra Hitmen website on May 6 last year and asked for Mr Tan's right hand to be cut off. He later asked for the younger man to be killed in a staged car accident and the murder was to take place between 7pm and 8pm on May 22 that year. Hui was told that he would need to pay the hitman only after the job was completed. Before that, he had to transfer sufficient bitcoins into his account on the Camorra Hitmen website as proof of his ability to pay. But on May 12 last year, a CBS journalist told the Singapore Embassy in Washington about the ""hit"". The Ministry of Foreign Affairs  He will be sentenced on Sept 18. For intentionally abetting Camorra Hitmen to kill the man, he can be jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

The court found Heeton Holdings, which operates the privately-owned wet market at Tampines Mart, and its subsidiary Heeton Estate jointly liable to pay damages to be assessed later. The case is unusual as it was not about a wet floor, which was to be expected of a wet market, but about a splatter of oil on the floor from unauthorised cooking. ""There are few known falls in a wet market perhaps because visitors know to walk with measured paces and careful balance because of present slip risks,"" said District Judge Loo Ngan Chor. ""It is noteworthy that the complaint before me was really not about a wet floor causing the plaintiff to slip and fall,"" he added in judgment grounds last month. The mishap occurred on Aug 5, 2011 around 3 pm when Ms Angela Lim, then 32, was walking along the corridor with her boyfriend Chee Jin Cheng when she slipped and landed painfully on her behind. The fall led to injuries including a fractured tailbone. When she landed, she touched the floor and felt the presence of oil. Ms Lim sued the defendants for breach of duty of care, in failing to ensure the wet market was operated in a safe manner so as not to cause danger. Her lawyers Raeza Ibrahim and Jonathan Cheah argued, among other things, that the tenant of a stall she walked past had occupied an untenanted stall on the other side of the corridor. Photographs taken by her boyfriend showed the presence of gas cylinders, two huge pots atop stoves and someone stirring one of the pots. This led the judge to infer that there was cooking going on at that stall, which was meant to be untenanted and vacant. The two-day trial earlier this year heard that Ms Lim had taken a route just outside a stall where cooking was improperly going on, stepping on two tiles which sloped slightly down to the flat corridor. The stall had no enclosures, unlike in a hawker centre. The judge noted that no cooking is allowed within the wet market, neither, as a matter of policy by the National Environment Agency, nor by the defendants. District Judge Loo found the type of cooking that was going on in the untenanted stall, adjacent to the corridor on which Ms Lim fell, ""did probably cause the oil splatter"". ""The defendants breached their duty of care to ensure a safe wet market when they failed to enforce the rule against cooking therein,"" added the judge. Defence lawyer Ramasamy Chettiar argued that Ms Lim contributed to the negligence in not explaining if she walked with care in the wet market. The judge held Ms Lim should have walked ""with more care, in a gingerly way, if you like, since she was entering a wet market. If she had done this, I do not think that she would have fallen because of an invisible splatter of oil from nearby cooking"". The judge assigned 35 per cent blame to Ms Lim for the fall - which means she stands to get 65 per cent of the awarded sum when damages are separately assessed. Personal injury claims in the State Courts are for awards of up to $250,000. Both parties are appealing against the decision. "

As a result, Public Transport Security Command (TransCom) officers of the Singapore Police Force were activated, and Exit A of Clarke Quay MRT station had to be closed for about 15 minutes. Ho Hee Hew, 59, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of harassment. He found the bag with the toy grenade somewhere. The court heard that the bag contained old toys. Ho was cycling near Exit A of Clarke Quay MRT station at around 4.30pm on Sept 16, 2017, when he spotted about 800 people at a protest against the reserved presidency in Hong Lim Park. He then flung the bag towards a nearby wheelchair ramp and left the scene. A man later found the unattended bag and alerted the police at around 5pm.

German national Michael Frank Hartung, 48, was convicted in July of two counts of distributing such information to four men, identified as Michael, Jackson, Paul and Frank. He had met the men in Singapore without realising they were undercover police officers. Their real names were not revealed in court documents. Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim earlier told the court during the trial that in April 2015, Singapore police received information that Hartung was suspected of being involved in ""deviant sexual activities"". Officers then planned an undercover operation as part of investigations. The court heard that Jackson began communicating with Hartung through the Yahoo online messaging service two months later. In their submissions, DPPs Lim and Andre Ong stated that Jackson told Hartung that he wanted to go overseas for a low-profile tour to engage in commercial sex with girls who were ""young"" and ""inexperienced"", and asked the German to organise the trip. The court heard that Hartung met Jackson and Michael at a Raffles City Shopping Centre cafe on Sept 26, 2015, and told them he had access to local contacts in the Philippines to facilitate such arrangements. The DPPs told District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam that Hartung said he would facilitate arrangements for six virgin girls aged between 14 and 16 to be provided to the men in the Philippines. Hartung also communicated with a man known as Darkthrone in an online portal for people into bondage, domination and sadomasochism, the court heard. It turned out that Darkthrone was Jackson and on Jan 20, 2016, the German reached out to the undercover policeman to ask him if he was interested in common projects. The DPPs stated: ""Darkthrone broached the subject of wanting to go overseas 'in Asia' to 'try young blood', a jargon, when mentioned within the relevant circle, which referred to the engagement of sexual acts and sexual conduct with minors."" Hartung later invited Darkthrone to meet for coffee and share ideas and tips before meeting Paul and Frank at a Mackenzie Road pub near Little India on April 15, 2016. Hartung intends to appeal against the judge's decision and was offered bail of $60,000. He still has four pending charges, including those involving possession of obscene films.

Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Nicholas Wuan said Ler's text message records with convicted drug abuser Sim Eng Chee showed that Ler was aware of the practice known as ""slamming"" and had injected illicit narcotics into abusers for a fee. Yet, Ler claimed he had only provided massage services and insisted that all references to ""slamming"" or the use of utensils in his messages were part of a running inside joke between him and Sim. DPP Wuan said that the doctor, who has been suspended, ""prevaricated"" on why he had methamphetamine-stained drug utensils with him when he was arrested with Sim on March 2 last year. Ler is facing a charge of possessing drug-related utensils that day, on top of a charge of injecting methamphetamine into Sim a few days earlier on Feb 26. After his arrest, he told Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers that a methamphetamine-stained syringe found on him was used to clean his teeth. However, Ler later testified that the syringe belonged to his American partner Mikhy Farrera-Brochez and that he had intended to throw it away. ""The accused's constant prevarications are testament to his lack of credibility and can be contrasted with Sim's testimony, which is clear and corroborated by the text message records,"" said DPP Wuan in the prosecution's closing submissions for the case. Ler, who is representing himself, responded that the prosecution's case rested solely on Sim, who had testified earlier in the trial to hiring Ler for ""slamming"" services. ""Sim's evidence is not substantiated by any independent physical evidence,"" said Ler, who is currently serving a sentence for drug consumption and possession. Ler added that Sim had ""changed his tune"" - the witness had initially told CNB officers that Ler had nothing to do with the drugs found on him - so that he could use it as a mitigating factor in his own case. Sim denied this claim earlier during the trial. DPP Wuan said Ler had not once tried to account for his text message records with Sim, the reason being that ""he knows the text messages are damning"". The case has been adjourned to next month. Ler and Farrera-Brochez - who was convicted in the United States of charges relating to leaked identification documents in Singapore - are at the centre of the HIV registry scandal, in which the details of 14,200 HIV-positive patients were leaked online.

Corruption of foreign public officials is an aggravating factor in sentencing, said a High Court judge yesterday as she increased the jail term, from 33 months to 40 months, imposed last year by a district court on Sharon Rachael Gursharan Kaur. The Singaporean woman was involved in the largest bribery and fraud conspiracy in the history of the United States Navy. Such cases threaten Singapore's international reputation for incorruptibility and run contrary to Singapore's obligations and efforts to combat transnational corruption, added the judge. Kaur is out on bail of $70,000 after her lawyer indicated that she may want to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, to make a definitive ruling on the legal issues. A lead contract specialist employed by the US Navy, Kaur received more than $130,000 in cash and luxury vacations for leaking confidential information to defence contractor Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian. Over a decade, Francis bribed US Navy personnel with millions so that they would feed him inside information. This enabled his company, Singapore-incorporated Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA) to secure lucrative contracts and overcharge for goods and services, defrauding the US Navy of about US$35 million. Investigations into the scandal resulted in the conviction of several senior US Navy officers. Francis pleaded guilty in the US in 2015 and is awaiting sentencing. On the part of Kaur, who was based in Singapore, the information she leaked was linked to 16 US Navy contracts. Of these, GDMA bid for 14, and was awarded 11 contracts worth a total of about US$48 million. Last year, she pleaded guilty to three corruption charges and one charge of using the benefits of her criminal conduct to acquire property. In February this year, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-Yue appealed for a longer jail term. The appeal arguments centred on whether a sentencing principle, known as the ""public service rationale"", should extend to a corruption case where the recipient or intended recipient of a bribe is a foreign public official. The rationale is that cases of corruption are aggravated when they jeopardise the integrity of public service, and the sentencing outcome for public-sector corruption is typically a custodial term. In her written judgment, Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said the corruption of foreign public officials should be recognised as an aggravating factor, but one that is distinct from the public service rationale. Kaur's lawyer Suresh Damodara argued that Kaur was merely a civilian employee of the US Navy, and thus not a public official, public officer or a public servant. But Justice Hoo said Kaur's case fell within this category of aggravated cases. The judge noted that definition of ""foreign public official"" within the United Nations Convention Against Corruption includes a person exercising a public function for a foreign country. She added: ""The nub of the foreign public-sector corruption should be the involvement of a person in the employment of a foreign government."" Justice Hoo noted that Kaur had actively solicited bribes from Francis on two occasions. "

Lawyers from Davinder Singh Chambers had served Mr Xu, 37, the writ of summons and statement of claim at his home in Choa Chu Kang on Thursday.

It had referenced a Facebook post made by PM Lee's sister, Dr Lee Wei Ling, in which she set out a purported sequence of events related to the 38 Oxley Road property. On Sunday, Mr Xu had received a letter of demand from PM Lee's press secretary Chang Li Lin to remove the offending article and Facebook post by Wednesday. He had not taken down the Facebook post by the deadline. The article, which was initially removed on Sunday evening, also reappeared on the TOC website.

This caused Mr Lee Kuan Yew to consider other alternatives to demolition, and to change his will to bequeath the house to PM Lee. The article also alleged that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had removed PM Lee as an executor and trustee of his will after it was revealed to him in late 2013 that the house had in fact not been gazetted. These baseless allegations were ""calculated to disparage and impugn"" PM Lee as well as his office as the Prime Minister, the lawyers said. They noted that TOC's Facebook post had attracted hundreds of reactions and comments, and was shared extensively, which meant the false allegations were disseminated to a wider audience. The article was also republished on the Internet on various blogs and websites, such as the HardwareZone forum, My Car Forum site and Under The Angsana Tree blog. PM Lee's lawyers said they will rely on the following facts to recover aggravated damages. First, the nature and gravity of the libel. Second, the mode, extent and timing of the publication of the libel. Third, malice on the part of Mr Xu, as he had published Ms Chang's letter on his website and made the article accessible again. PM Lee is claiming damages, an injunction to restrain Mr Xu from publishing or disseminating the allegations and costs.

Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Nicholas Wuan said Ler's text message records with convicted drug abuser Sim Eng Chee showed he not only knew the lingo, but he had carried out the procedure as well. Yet Ler avoided the truth about the text messages, said DPP Wuan, claiming he only provided massage services. He also insisted that all references to ""slamming"" or the use of utensils in his messages were part of a running inside joke between him and Sim. DPP Wuan said Ler's defence is ""incoherent and defies logic"", adding that the doctor, who has been suspended, also ""prevaricated"" on why he had methamphetamine-stained drug utensils with him when he was arrested on March 2 last year with Sim. Ler is facing a charge of possessing drug-related utensils on that day, on top of a charge of injecting methamphetamine into Sim a few days earlier on Feb 26. After his arrest, he told Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers that a methamphetamine-stained syringe found on him was used to ""clean his teeth"", but later testified that the same syringe belonged to his partner, Mikhy Farrera-Brochez, and he had intended to throw it away. ""The accused's constant prevarications are testament to his lack of credibility and can be contrasted with Sim's testimony, which is clear and corroborated by the text message records,"" said DPP Wuan, in the prosecution's closing submissions for the case. In response, Ler, who is representing himself, said the prosecution's case rested solely on Sim, who had testified earlier in the trial to hiring Ler for ""slamming"" services. ""Sim's evidence is not substantiated by any independent physical evidence,"" he said, pointing out that the only evidence to substantiate Sim's words were the text messages, which also came from Sim. ""We can't say that he's substantiating himself,"" said Ler, who is currently serving a sentence for drug consumption and possession. He added that Sim had ""changed his tune"", as the witness initially told CNB officers that Ler had ""nothing to do"" with the drugs found on him. Ler said Sim had made the ""180-degrees flip-flop"" to accuse him, so Sim could use it as a mitigating factor in his own case. Sim had denied this claim earlier during the trial. On Friday, DPP Wuan pointed out that the text message records only made sense when read in conjunction with Sim's testimony. Ler had not once tried to account for the numerous text accounts between him and Sim, and the reason is telling, he said. ""He is urging this court to place no weight on text messages. It is clear why his case is as such, because he knows the text messages are damning,"" said DPP Wuan. The case has been adjourned to next month. Ler and Farrera-Brochez are at the centre of the HIV registry scandal, where the details of 14,200 HIV positive patients were leaked online. Farrera-Brochez was convicted in the United States on charges relating to the leaked identification documents in Singapore. "

German national Michael Frank Hartung, 48, was convicted in July of two counts of distributing such information to four men, identified only as Michael, Jackson, Paul and Frank. He had met the men in Singapore without realising that they were undercover police officers. Their real names were not revealed in court documents. On Friday, the court heard that Hartung is married and has a young daughter who is enrolled in a kindergarten in China. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam noted that the Singapore permanent resident had committed the offence twice. Deputy Public Prosecutor Marshall Lim had earlier told the court during the trial that in April 2015, Singapore police received information that Hartung was suspected of being involved in ""deviant sexual activities"". Officers then planned an undercover operation as part of investigations. The court heard that Jackson began communicating with Hartung through the Yahoo online messaging service two months later. In their submissions, DPPs Lim and Andre Ong stated that Jackson told Hartung that he wanted to go overseas for a low-profile tour to engage in commercial sex with girls who were ""young"" and ""inexperienced"", and asked the German to organise the trip. The court heard that Hartung met Jackson and Michael at a cafe in Raffles City Shopping Centre on Sept 26, 2015, and told the pair that he had access to local contacts in the Philippines to facilitate such arrangements. The DPPs told Judge Ng that Hartung also said he would facilitate arrangements for six virgin girls aged between 14 and 16 to be provided to the men in the Philippines. Hartung also communicated with a man known as Darkthrone in an online portal for people interested in bondage, domination and sadomasochism, the court heard. It turned out that Darkthrone was Jackson and on Jan 20, 2016, the German reached out to the undercover policeman to ask him if he was interested in common and shared projects. The DPPs stated: ""Darkthrone broached the subject of wanting to go overseas 'in Asia' to 'try young blood' - a jargon (term), when mentioned within the relevant circle, that referred to the engagement of sexual acts and sexual conduct with minors."" Hartung later invited Darkthrone to meet for coffee and share ideas and tips before meeting Paul and Frank at a Mackenzie Road pub near Little India on April 15, 2016. The DPPs told the judge: ""The accused gave advice on the possible destinations for a sex tour with minors overseas... The accused advised that it would be easier to procure girls within the six- to 12-year-old age bracket during such periods."" Hartung also revealed that he had access to a middleman in the Philippines to facilitate the arrangements and shared his personal experience with procuring young girls for sexual services, the court heard. Offenders convicted of distributing information promoting child sex activities can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each charge. Hartung intends to appeal against the judge's decision and was offered bail of $60,000. He still has four pending charges, including those involving the possession of obscene films. The pre-trial conference for these cases will be held on Sept 18. "

As a result, TransCom officers of the Singapore Police Force were activated and Exit A of Clarke Quay MRT station had to be closed for about 15 minutes. Ho Hee Hew, 59, pleaded guilty on Friday (Sept 6) to one count of harassment. He had earlier found the bag with the attached toy grenade elsewhere. The court heard that the bag contained old toys. Ho was cycling near Exit A of Clarke Quay MRT station at around 4.30pm on Sept 16, 2017 when he spotted about 800 people at a protest against the reserved presidency in Hong Lim Park. He then flung the bag towards a nearby wheelchair ramp and left the scene. A man later found the unattended bag and alerted the police at around 5pm. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran said: ""Exit A was closed for about 15 minutes, which caused inconvenience to 20 passengers. TransCom officers found that the bag did not contain a threat to public safety. The bag did not cause any disturbance to the protesters."" Ho was captured on a closed-circuit television camera committing the offence and police arrested him the next day He later told officers that he disagreed with the protesters and wanted to cause alarm so that they would leave the area, the court heard.

A High Court judge said this on Friday (Sept 6) as she increased the jail term, from 33 months to 40 months, imposed on Sharon Rachael Gursharan Kaur, the Singaporean woman involved in the largest bribery and fraud conspiracy in the history of the United States Navy. Kaur is out on bail of $70,000 after her lawyer indicated that she may want to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, to make a definitive ruling on the legal issues. A lead contract specialist employed by the US Navy, Kaur received more than $130,000 in cash and luxury vacations for leaking confidential information to defence contractor Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian known as ""Fat Leonard"". Over a decade, Francis bribed US Navy personnel with millions in cash, sex with prostitutes and lavish hotel stays so that they would feed him inside information. This enabled his company, Singapore-incorporated Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA), to secure lucrative contracts and overcharge for goods and services, defrauding the US Navy of about US$35 million (S$48 million). Investigations into the scandal resulted in the conviction of several senior US Navy officers, including a Rear-Admiral. Francis pleaded guilty in the US in 2015 and is awaiting sentencing. On the part of Kaur, who was based in Singapore, the inside information she leaked was linked to 16 US Navy contracts. Of these, GDMA bid for 14, and was awarded 11 contracts worth a total of about US$48 million. Last year,  In February, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-Yue appealed for a longer jail term. The appeal arguments centred on whether a sentencing principle, known as the ""public service rationale"", should extend to a corruption case where the recipient or intended recipient of a bribe is a foreign public official. The rationale is that cases of corruption are aggravated when they jeopardise the integrity of public service, and the sentencing outcome for public sector corruption is typically a custodial term. In her written judgment, Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said the corruption of foreign public officials should be recognised as an aggravating factor, but one that is distinct from the public service rationale. The judge said such cases threaten Singapore's international reputation for incorruptibility and run contrary to Singapore's obligations and efforts to combat transnational corruption. Kaur's lawyer Suresh Damodara argued that she was merely a civilian employee of the US Navy, and thus not a public official, public officer or a public servant. But Justice Hoo said Kaur's case fell within this category of aggravated cases. The judge noted that the definition of ""foreign public official"" within the United Nations Convention Against Corruption includes a person exercising a public function for a foreign country. She added: ""The nub of the foreign public sector corruption should be the involvement of a person in the employment of a foreign government. It does not matter if the person is a civilian employee as opposed to one in the uniformed service."" Justice Hoo said Kaur's original sentence was manifestly inadequate, considering the aggravating feature. She also noted that Kaur had actively solicited bribes from Francis on two occasions. The judgment also dealt with the case of Michael Tan Kok Ming, the owner of an oil trading company who gave $10,000 to an intermediary for officers of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency to detain a competitor's vessel. Tan's sentence of four months' jail was not disturbed. "

Lawyer Then Feng, 37, when pressed for the return of the monies, claimed in court papers filed last month that Mr Andrew Ling, who controlled both firms, had agreed not to start this lawsuit while both took steps to recover the funds from a mutual friend to whom it was loaned. The US$2.5 million is the subject of a High Court suit by the two firms - Providence Asset Management and another firm named 5 and 2 - against Mr Then, a former counsel in the Singapore office of global law firm Walkers, and two other parties related to him. Both the plaintiffs and defendants have given differing accounts of events. Mr Ling, director of the two investment services firms, understood last year that Mr Then could arrange for Walkers to provide services for facilitating business deals. It also emerged that Mr Then also ran Walkers Professional Services (WPS), a name he allegedly chose for its similarity to the Walkers law firm. In the middle of last year, Mr Then told Mr Ling about a bank in Curacao, a Caribbean island off the Venezuelan coast, that was available for purchase at US$8.5 million and that Walkers could represent the buyers. Mr Then said he would also be a partner in the new venture. He used his Walkers law firm e-mail account to correspond with the Curacao party, who later agreed to sell two banks for US$8.5 million. Last October, around US$5.5 million was transferred to WPS for the potential purchases. One deal was inked but the other fell through and the two companies, represented by lawyers Daniel Chia and Ker Yanguang, sued for the refund of an unused US$2.5 million. In court papers filed last month, they alleged, among other things, that Mr Then made ""fraudulent misrepresentations"" to induce them to transfer the funds. Mr Then, in contesting the claims, argued that the plaintiffs were at all times aware WPS was distinct, separate and free of any control by Walkers. He said, in defence papers filed by Senior Counsel Siraj Omar and lawyer Audie Wong, that the standing arrangement with Mr Ling was for Providence to hire Walkers for legal advice on any of its deals, but Mr Then would help Providence in his personal capacity on non-legal matters and for services Walkers did not provide. Mr Then said the remaining funds sought were loaned to Swiss national Frederick Gaillard, a mutual friend of his and Mr Ling, who was shown evidence of the debt. Both agreed to work together to expedite repayment by Mr Gaillard and agreed no steps would be taken to recover the funds from Mr Then or WPS while this was being done. This ""hold-hands"" pact precluded the two companies from starting this suit, claimed Mr Then. Mr Then said that as in all past matters, it was clear Mr Ling was authorised to speak for the firms. A High Court pre-trial conference is due this month. "

They would chat and call each other every day on messaging platform WhatsApp. ""He told me that after his mother died about five years ago, he felt empty and alone and needed someone in his life,"" Alice told reporters yesterday in an interview.

She said the man would send her romantic poems every day and selfies and photos of his life which ""seemed so real"" that she did not suspect anything. He also asked her several times to be his girlfriend and said he would come to Singapore to meet her, but she declined as she was still recovering from the break-up. After just two weeks, the man asked her for a loan of US$5,000 (S$7,000). Largest amount lost in an Internet love scam in the first six months of this year.

Keen to help her online friend, she transferred the money via Internet mobile banking to a US account under Interaudi Bank. A few days later, the man claimed he had not received the funds and asked her to make a second transfer. This time, Alice suspected something was amiss. Without alerting the man, she checked on the status of the transfer with her bank, which confirmed that it had been successfully made. Realising he may not have been telling her the truth, Alice sought advice from her sister. She made a police report on Aug 20.

Principal psychologists Carolyn Misir and Jeffery Chin from the Singapore Police Force warned that anyone could become a victim of an Internet love scam.

They would also target their victims at a time of vulnerability, such as after the end of a relationship, a divorce or an emotional event, said Ms Misir. For Alice, her close shave with an Internet love scammer has left her distrustful of others, even in person. ""I'm considered lucky, but I've heard other stories where other victims were hurt badly. Don't put too much trust into these online relationships so you can protect yourself,"" she said. "

The 43-year-old IT manager met a man on a popular dating app who claimed he was born in Taiwan but was now living in the United States as a diamond dealer. They would chat and call each other every day on messaging platform WhatsApp. ""He told me that after his mother died about five years ago, he has been feeling empty and alone, and needed someone in his life,"" Alice told reporters on Wednesday (Sept 4) in an interview arranged by the police to warn of online love scams that have seen an uptick. She said he would send her romantic poems every day, and selfies and photos of his life that ""seemed so real"", she did not suspect anything was awry. He also asked her several times to be his girlfriend and said he would come to Singapore to meet her, but she declined as she was still healing from her break-up. After just two weeks, the man asked her for a loan of US$5,000 (S$7,000). ""He said he had a package of diamonds worth US$800,000 and needed help to pay the custom fees so that the package could reach his clients,"" said Alice, who spoke to journalists at the Police Headquarters. Keen to help her online friend, Alice made the transfer via Internet mobile banking to a US bank account under Interaudi Bank. A few days later, he told her that he did not receive the money and asked her to make a second transfer. This time, Alice's suspicions were raised. Without alerting the man, she checked on the status of the transfer with her bank, which confirmed that the transfer was successfully made. Realising that he may not have been telling her the truth, Alice sought advice from her sister. On Aug 20, Alice made a police report after discovering she had been scammed. While she was lucky enough to eventually get back her money after notifying the police, many other victims of Internet love scams are not. In the first half of this year, there were 306 cases of Internet love scams reported to the police, up from the 288 cases in the same period last year. Victims lost a total of $17.1 million - a 46 per cent increase from the $11.7 million in the same period last year. The largest amount cheated in a single case in the first six months of this year was $2.4 million.

Scammers often use compliance and persuasion tactics in order to get victims to transfer money to them, they added. For example, scammers may study their targets and create a fake profile to match what their potential victims may find attractive in a partner. They also try to catch their victims at a time of vulnerability, such as after the loss of a relationship, divorce, or emotional event in their lives, added Ms Misir. In Alice's case, she was savvy enough to be able to pick up on the red flags, said Mr Chin. ""All victims of Internet love scams usually would develop suspicions at some point, but most of them don't act on them because they would have to let go of the bond that was formed, so sometimes, they choose not to see the signs,"" he added. ""It's not just a monetary loss, but the loss of a relationship is akin to the loss of a loved one."" To tackle love scams,  Bank staff have also been trained to spot customers who may be victims of scams. The psychologists said family and friends can also help by keeping an eye out. ""Don't make transactions to people you don't know, and don't be afraid to tell someone if you think you may have become a victim,"" said Ms Misir. For Alice, her close shave with an Internet love scammer has left her distrustful of others, even in real life.

In a separate incident, the offender, who is now a 20-year-old full-time national serviceman (NSF), also raped a distant relative, who regarded him as her ""cousin"". The offender, who cannot be named to protect his victims' identities, has pleaded guilty to two counts of rape. He also admitted to one count of affray - disturbing the peace by fighting in a public place. He met the first victim when they were in secondary school and she later became his girlfriend. In February 2015, the couple, who frequently quarrelled, broke up. Despite this, they had consensual sexual intercourse in March and September that year. On Nov 15, 2015, the pair met at a coffee shop and he later offered to take her home on his electric bicycle, which was at his home in Tampines. The pair went to the flat, where the victim, then 17, saw that his father, grandmother and younger sister were having dinner in the living room. She went to her former boyfriend's bedroom and he raped her after closing the door. After committing the offence, he ordered her to kneel in front of him for five minutes and she complied out of fear. Deputy Public Prosecutor Mansoor Amir said: ""A scuffle later ensued between them, during which the victim screamed... The victim then heard the accused's grandmother calling out to them asking what had happened. ""The victim was crying and did not answer. The accused's father then opened the bedroom door with a spare key and asked them what happened... They did not answer him."" The offender later invited his friends to the flat and he told them that he had raped his former girlfriend. ""Everyone just kept quiet,"" said the DPP. The girl finally left the flat at around 11.30pm and the police were alerted. On Oct 13, 2016, the youth raped his second victim, who was then 16 years old, at another flat in Buangkok when no one else was home. After committing the offence, he told the girl that he did not want her to lodge a police report as he was under investigation for the earlier rape. The DPP said: ""The victim then started crying and she promised the accused that she would not report the matter. The victim made this promise because she was anxious to leave the flat."" The offender's mother arrived at the flat soon after and took the victim home. The teenager made a police report about a month later, the court heard. District Judge Eddy Tham has called for a report to assess the NSF's suitability for reformative training. Offenders given it will be detained in a reformative training centre to follow a strict regimen that includes foot drills and counselling. The accused is expected to be sentenced on Sept 10. For each count of rape, offenders can be jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned. "

The court heard that the man taught at a local school where he was in charge of the girl's co-curricular activity (CCA). The name of the school and the CCA were redacted from court documents seen by The Straits Times. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Tan said that, before committing the offence, the teacher had been exchanging text messages with the girl. They had also gone out together on two earlier occasions, for a haircut on July 18 last year and, six days later, for tea at a shopping mall. On July 28 last year, the teacher was a chaperone for a school outing and he accompanied the girl and her schoolmates to watch a play. When the show ended, he asked her out to dinner and she accepted his invitation. The pair then went to a Japanese restaurant near Orchard Road. DPP Tan told District Judge Salina Ishak: ""After they finished dinner, the accused asked the victim to sit next to him. The victim complied. ""When the victim sat next to the accused, the accused placed his right arm over the victim's shoulder. The accused then leaned towards the victim and kissed the victim on her lips. The victim was shocked and nervous."" The court heard that she burst out laughing as she was unsure how to react. After they left the restaurant, the girl told him that she wanted to go home as it was late. They were walking up a flight of stairs when he called out to her. She turned around and he kissed her again on her lips. After that, they took a bus to her father's home before parting ways. She later told another teacher about the incident and the police were alerted. In an earlier statement, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education told The Straits Times that the teacher has been suspended since last September and is no longer at the school. First-time offenders convicted of committing an indecent act on a minor can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $20,000. "

The court heard the punch-up occurred after the victim chided the teacher for making racist remarks at a taxi stand. Education technology coach William Samuel Pettijohn, 31, who used to work as a bouncer back home in the United States, punched Briton Arora Neil Kant's face once. But that single blow was enough to cause Mr Arora to suffer fractures, including to his left eye socket. The court heard that Mr Arora, a 49-year-old Singapore permanent resident, has since undergone surgery to reconstruct the eye socket with titanium plates and has lost sensation from underneath his nose up to his cheekbone. He also has peripheral double vision and occasional flashbacks of the assault. On Tuesday (Sept 3), District Judge Mathew Joseph sentenced Pettijohn to 20 months' jail after convicting him of one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. The teacher was also ordered to compensate the older man $1,000. In handing down the sentence, the judge said that the case, which involved ""racist remarks and intoxicated persons"", had ""dire consequences to those involved"". He said it was ""very disturbing"" that a single blow could cause such injuries, adding that it ""goes to show the... intensity of that.. punch"". In their submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Kelly Ho and Ho Jiayun stated that Pettijohn had gone to the Oktoberfest event with a colleague, Mr David Michael Rive, 35, at the club in Swiss Club Road, near Dunearn Road, in September 2017. Mr Arora had also gone there with his own friends. The DPPs stated that both groups left the Swiss Club at around 1am on Sept 24 and were at a taxi stand when Mr Arora overheard Pettijohn making racist remarks at another man. Court documents said Mr Arora chided the teacher for doing so and a verbal dispute ensued. Security guards eventually intervened and separated both parties. The court heard that Mr Arora and his friends then left the taxi stand and were walking towards the main road when they saw Pettijohn and Mr Rive approaching them ""for no apparent reason"". All of a sudden, a man in Mr Arora's group fell to the ground. The DPPs stated: ""Afraid that the accused might push or hit someone else, (Mr Arora) used both his hands to hold on to the bottom of the accused's rolled-up sleeves. ""However, the accused managed to break free of (Mr Arora's) grip. Almost instantly, (Mr Arora) felt a blow to the left side of his head... (he) lost consciousness, and the accused immediately fled."" The police were notified and Mr Arora was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he was warded for six days. Pettijohn is represented by lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam, Syazana Yahya and Haziq Ika. The defence claimed it was Mr Rive who had made the comments and that Mr Arora accused the New Zealander of racism. A dispute broke out between the two groups and Pettijohn claimed that he had acted in ""self-defence"" when he punched Mr Arora, who had held on to one of his sleeves. The prosecutors stated: ""Even if it were accepted that the accused had a right to self-defence, he had exceeded that right by inflicting more harm than was necessary to defend himself."" They also stressed that Pettijohn, who is 1.82m tall and weighs 110kg, had a ""very large build"". On Tuesday, the court heard that Pettijohn intends to appeal against the conviction and sentence. He was offered bail of $20,000. Responding to queries from The Straits Times, Mr Tyler Sherwood, who is the head of schools at Chatsworth International School, said that Pettijohn has been suspended as a result of his conviction. Mr Sherwood added that the school has supported the teacher throughout the ""ordeal"" and expressed hope of a favourable outcome for his appeal. ST understands that Mr Rive is no longer working at the school. For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Pettijohn could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. "

The man, now 22, had slipped his hand into her underwear and told her ""remember this"", and then scratched her, causing injuries that took two weeks to heal. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong argued yesterday that while the offender was young, deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration as there was no causal link between his autism spectrum disorder and the offence. ""There was a real sexual motivation borne out of arousal; it was borne out of sexual intent,"" she told the High Court. The DPP did not seek caning. She noted that people with autism may have hyper-or hypo-sensitivity to sensory input, which could make caning a more disproportionate punishment for him. The defence, on the other hand, pressed for probation, arguing that rehabilitation should be at the forefront for a young offender. ""If he was to go to jail, I don't think he can survive,"" said Mr Shashi Nathan, noting that the man's parents have taken care of various aspects of his life. Justice Pang Khang Chau adjourned the case to find out why the man had been exempted from national service. The judge also asked for a report by a Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) psychologist to be shown to two psychiatrists who had earlier said there was a link between the man's actions and his autism. In the MSF report, the accused disclosed that he was fantasising about a pornographic scene while molesting the victim. He also admitted to watching pornography - which he had previously denied. The man, who cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the victim's identity, pleaded guilty in April to a charge of molesting a person under the age of 14. The court heard that he had started taking piano lessons from the owner of the studio in 2013. After he completed his piano diploma and his GCE Normal (Academic)-level exams in 2015, his father arranged for him to teach piano part-time at the studio. On Nov 7, 2016, while he was alone with the victim as usual during a lesson, he told her to sit properly. He told her that he had to correct her posture while she was playing the piano, then slipped his hand inside her underwear and scratched her around her genital area. She repeatedly uttered ""ouch"" and told him to stop, but he continued while apologising. The girl, who did not know her private parts should not be touched without her consent, did not tell her grandfather what happened when he came to pick her up. At home, when she took an unusually long time in the toilet, her mother went to check on her and found her crying in pain. The girl then revealed what her teacher had done to her, and her father called the police. After the incident, the girl had several episodes of bed-wetting and was seeing a counsellor. The DPP sought a compensation order of $7,000. Mr Nathan said his client had no issue with paying for the victim's counselling sessions. However, he took issue with a victim impact statement submitted by the prosecution, in which the girl said she would not be able to enjoy her upcoming birthday if the man was not jailed. Justice Pang agreed that while he had to know how the victim suffered, it was inappropriate to ""exert emotional blackmail"" on the court. "

Joyner Tai Liang Yun, who was an administrative support assistant before becoming operationally ready in July last year, fled when the 33-year-old woman spotted the device and shouted. His laptop was later seized as a case exhibit after he committed the offence on Aug 8, 2017, and it was found to contain videos of other women in toilets. Tai, 24, who pleaded guilty to four counts of insulting a woman's modesty and three criminal trespass charges, was sentenced yesterday to 14 weeks' jail. Twelve other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The court heard that Tai had committed such offences even before he enlisted for NS on July 11, 2016. He was a polytechnic student in July 2015 when he spotted a woman entering a toilet at his school. He waited for about one minute before entering the toilet. Deputy Public Prosecutor Regina Lim said: ""The accused was curious about what was happening inside the cubicle that the female was in."" Tai decided to ""secretly take a video of her while she was inside the cubicle so that he could watch it later and satisfy his curiosity"", said DPP Lim. He entered an empty cubicle next to the one the woman was in and used his device to record a video of her. He left the toilet soon after without being seen, the court heard. The name of his school has been redacted from court documents. On Nov 11, 2016, he recorded a video of a woman changing in a toilet at his workplace. About a month later, he was with his aunt at a Rochor Road supermarket when he snapped upskirt pictures of a fellow shopper. Before sentencing him yesterday, District Judge Adam Nakhoda said that Tai's offences ""cannot be attributed to youthful folly"" as he had committed most of them after turning 21. Tai is now out on bail of $15,000 and will surrender himself at the State Courts on Oct 31 to begin serving his sentence. For each count of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined. "

The police had received a call about the case at around 3.40am on Sunday and officers found Madam Lim motionless in the unit. She was later pronounced dead by paramedics. Neighbours told The Straits Times that Pak and Madam Lim were not married to each other but had lived in the same flat for more than 20 years. They described Madam Lim as a friendly person who looked younger than her age, and said they had never heard any arguments or quarrels coming from the unit. Retiree Goh Leng Sim, who lives in the unit below their flat, said Madam Lim worked at a McDonald's outlet at Safra Toa Payoh and had two sons and two daughters. The 86-year-old said that although they rarely spoke, she had bumped into Madam Lim when the latter was going out to exercise in the morning. ST visited the McDonald's outlet and confirmed that Madam Lim worked there from 2013, but had resigned a few months ago. A former colleague, who declined to be named, said the staff called Madam Lim ""Ah Ma"" and were very fond of her, adding: ""She always treated the younger ones like her own grandchildren."" Chinese-language daily Lianhe Wanbao reported that police officers had cordoned off the flat on Sunday morning and were seen gathering evidence inside the unit, including personal items such as a pillow and pillowcase.

Thiruchelvam Maniam ran away when the 30-year-old woman woke up, and she alerted the police. The 40-year-old Singaporean was sentenced yesterday to 61/2 years' jail and three strokes of the cane after pleading guilty to penetrating the victim without her consent. A molestation charge involving the same woman was considered during sentencing. Thiruchelvam committed these offences at a bus stop in Jalan Bukit Merah at around 2.50am on April 20 last year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana said the woman had gone to a pub with her boyfriend on April 19 last year and they had drunk ""a substantial amount"" of alcohol with their friends. The couple left the nightspot at around 1am the next day and had originally intended to walk to the boyfriend's motorcycle at a nearby carpark. The DPP told District Judge Carol Ling that due to their intoxication, the pair decided to rest on a bench at a bus stop, where they both fell asleep. Thiruchelvam spotted the couple as he was walking past. DPP Sruthi said: ""He paced around the bus stop for approximately 30 minutes while avoiding being seen by passers-by. ""After ensuring that no one was around, the accused then picked up the victim and moved her to another bench at the same bus stop, away from her boyfriend.""

The court heard that the woman burst into tears and told her boyfriend about what happened when he woke up. She alerted the police and Thiruchelvam was arrested later that day. Urging Judge Ling to give a sentence of at least seven years' jail with three strokes of the cane, DPP Sruthi said Thiruchelvam had ""taken advantage of the victim who was in a vulnerable state due to her intoxication"". Defence lawyer Michael Chang, who was assigned to the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, told the court that his client was remorseful and ashamed of his actions. For sexually penetrating the woman without her consent, Thiruchelvam could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned. "

Court documents showed that Fazli Hisham Mohd Fairuz Shah, 29, was a qualified pilot when he committed the offences on Feb 1, 2017, and worked for the carrier between October 2016 and July 2017. The WhatsApp group was known as ""hijau, kuning, merah"" (Malay for green, yellow, red). The court heard that a man in the group shared the photos with three maids, one of whom then posted them on Facebook. They were then circulated on social media before the police were alerted on Feb 3, 2017. On Aug 26 following a trial, the court found Fazli guilty of two offences under the Official Secrets Act (OSA). His girlfriend, Nurizzah Afiqah Hussain, was fined $3,000 in August last year after pleading guilty to two OSA-related offences. The 27-year-old was working for private ambulance operator Unistrong Technology when she attended to an incident at a condominium in the east on Feb 1, 2017. While at the apartment, ambulance driver Shaik Haziq Fahmi Shaik Nasair Johar, 29, took a photo of the dead woman and shared it in a WhatsApp group called STN21. Haziq was fined $1,500 in September last year for also committing an OSA-related offence. Nurizzah, who was part of the group, then forwarded the photo to her boyfriend. In turn, Fazli shared it in the WhatsApp group, along with a photo of a document that stated ""Maid hung (sic) herself on the fan"". This picture of the document was also sent by Nurizzah, the court heard. In his defence, Fazli claimed he was ""completely ignorant of his girlfriend's work"" and the nature of the photos, saying he thought ""it was something interesting to share"". But Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Zu Zhao said that such a notion would be ""inconsistent with his (national service) background as a section commander in the Special Rescue Platoon in the (Singapore Civil Defence Force)"". The DPP added: ""From his performance on the stand, the accused clearly demonstrated himself to be an intelligent and articulate person. ""In addition... his description of the rigours of his training (as a pilot) and what he did during his time at Singapore Airlines makes it clear that he is used to functioning in situations of fatigue and high pressure."" District Judge Luke Tan had said earlier that Fazli would have been aware that the pictures were obtained by Nurizzah in the course of her work. Nurizzah and Haziq are no longer working for Unistrong Technology. "

Joyner Tai Liang Yun, who was an administrative support assistant before becoming operationally ready in July last year, fled when the 33-year-old woman spotted the device and shouted. His laptop was later seized as a case exhibit after he committed the offence on Aug 8, 2017, and it was found to contain videos of other women in toilets. Tai, 24, who pleaded guilty to four counts of insulting a woman's modesty and three charges of criminal trespass, was sentenced on Monday (Sept 2) to 14 weeks' jail. Twelve other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The court heard that Tai had committed such offences even before he enlisted for NS on July 11, 2016. He was a polytechnic student in July 2015 when he spotted a woman entering a toilet at his school. He waited for about one minute before entering the toilet. Deputy Public Prosecutor Regina Lim said: ""The accused was curious about what was happening inside the cubicle that the female was in."" Tai decided to ""secretly take a video of her while she was inside the cubicle so that he could watch it later and satisfy his curiosity"", said DPP Lim. After that, he entered an empty cubicle next to the one the woman was in and used his device to record a video of her. He left the toilet without being seen soon after, the court heard. The name of his school has been redacted from court documents. On Nov 11, 2016, he recorded a video of a woman changing her clothes in a toilet at his workplace. About a month later, he was with his aunt at a Rochor Road supermarket when he snapped upskirt pictures of a fellow shopper. Before sentencing him on Monday, District Judge Adam Nakhoda said that Tai's offences ""cannot be attributed to youthful folly"", as he had committed most of them after turning 21. Tai is now out on bail of $15,000 and will surrender himself at the State Courts on Oct 31 to begin serving his sentence. For each count of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined. "

The man, now 22, had slipped his hand into her underwear and told her ""remember this"", and then scratched her, causing injuries that took two weeks to heal. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong argued on Monday (Sept 2) that while the offender was young, deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration as there was no causal link between his autism spectrum disorder and the offence. ""There was a real sexual motivation borne out of arousal, it was borne out of sexual intent,"" she told the High Court. The DPP said: ""There is no evidence that he had misinterpreted the victim's social cues, or had any difficulty in communicating with her, to misunderstand that she was consenting in any way to the sexual violation."" The DPP did not seek caning. She noted that people with autism may have hyper or hypo sensitivity to sensory input, which could make caning a more disproportionate punishment for him. The defence, on the other hand, pressed for probation, arguing that rehabilitation should be at the forefront for a young offender. ""If he was to go to jail, I don't think he can survive,"" said Mr Shashi Nathan, noting that the man's parents have taken care of various aspects of his life. Justice Pang Khang Chau adjourned the case to find out why the man had been exempted from national service. The judge also asked for a report by a Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) psychologist to be shown to two psychiatrists who had earlier said that autism had a link to the man's actions. In the MSF report, the accused disclosed he was fantasising about a pornographic scene while molesting the victim. He also admitted watching pornography. Previously, he did not admit having any sexual thoughts while molesting the victim and insisted that he did not watch pornography. The man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity, pleaded guilty in April to a charge of molesting a person under the age of 14. The court heard that he started taking piano lessons from the owner of the studio in 2013. After he completed his piano diploma and his GCE Normal (Academic) Level exams in 2015, his father arranged for him to teach piano part time at the studio. At the time of the offence, he had seven students aged between five and 15, with the victim being the youngest and the only girl he taught individually. On Nov 7, 2016, while he was alone with the victim during the lesson as usual, he told her to sit properly. He told her that he had to correct her posture while she was playing the piano, then slipped his hand inside her underwear and scratched her around her genital area. She repeatedly uttered ""ouch"" and told him to stop, but he continued while apologising. The girl, who did not know her private parts should not be touched without her consent, did not tell her grandfather what happened when he came to pick her up. At home, when she took an unusually long time in the toilet, her mother went to check on her and found her crying in pain. The girl then revealed what her teacher had done to her, and her father called the police. After the incident, the girl has had several episodes of bedwetting and has been seeing a counsellor. The DPP sought a compensation order of $7,000. Mr Nathan said his client had no issue with paying for her counselling sessions. However, he took issue with a victim impact statement submitted by the prosecution, in which the girl said she would not be able to enjoy her upcoming birthday if the man was not jailed. Justice Pang agreed that while he had to know how the victim suffered, it was inappropriate to ""exert emotional blackmail"" on the court. "

Lye Wai Choong, 60, the director of the Centre for Kidney Diseases, admitted to six counts of tax-related offences - two for abetting his centre in omitting business income without reasonable excuse, and four for filing incorrect Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns. Nine similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The offences started in 2011, when Lye's centre filed incorrect GST returns for 12 quarters until December 2013, a district court heard. His centre also omitted certain business income from tax returns between 2012 and 2014 without reasonable excuse. Court papers stated that Lye employed Ms Norma Wati Suari to handle finance and administrative matters. Ms Norma had told patients to make payments directly to Lye instead of to the centre. As a result, these payments did not appear in the centre's tax books. Lye also did not declare the money in his own personal income tax returns. The amount of income omitted through such methods was close to $6 million, resulting in the undercharging of about $1 million in income tax, court documents showed. ""The accused was the controlling mind of the centre,"" said court papers, which noted that Lye knew about the payments and deposits made and did not ensure the accuracy of the tax returns. In addition, the centre also failed to account for GST of $419,426 after it provided ""incorrect information as to its liability"" for the tax. ""As director of the centre, the accused had not shown that he had exercised due diligence in ensuring that GST was properly reported in the GST returns of the centre,"" said court papers. The penalties - which are twice the sum of undercharged tax - came to around $1.8 million. Lye was fined an additional $21,000. He could have been fined a maximum of $5,000 and jailed for up to three years for each of the six charges, in addition to paying penalties that amount to twice the sum of undercharged tax. Lye has made full restitution of the taxes owed. "

E-commerce, loan, credit-for-sex and Internet love scams made up 80 per cent of the top 10 scam types reported during the period. The number of cases related to these four scam types increased by almost 60 per cent compared to the same period last year.  The number of scams related to loans and credit-for-sex as well as the total amount cheated for both more than doubled in the first six months this year compared to the same period last year.  Last year, there were 315 loan scams from Jan to June, resulting in losses of at least $670,000.

The largest amount lost in a single case was $80,000.  Police said iTunes cards and Alipay remained the most common platforms used for money transfers in credit-for-sex scams.  E-commerce scams and Internet love scams also continued to mount.  The number of cases for e-commerce scams rose from 1,013 to to 1,435 – the highest reported number of cases among all types of scams. The total amount of losses climbed from $870,000 to $1.2 million. The largest amount in a single case was $43,000. About  Common transactions on the platform that turned out to be scams involved the sale of electronic items, tickets, hotel room bookings and vehicle rentals.  “The drop could be attributed to the anti-scam initiatives that Carousell has worked closely with the police to push out on its platform,” said the Singapore Police Force in a statement on Friday (Aug 30).  Instead, there was a rise in the  The number of Internet love scams also rose, from 288 in the first half of last year to 306 in the same period this year. Victims lost a total of $17.1 million this year, compared with $11.7 in the same period last year. The largest amount in a single case was about $2.4 million.  Other common scams in Singapore were related to investment ruses, business e-mail impersonations,China officials impersonations, lucky draws, Facebook impersonations, and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority impersonations. To bolster efforts to fight scams, the police have set up an  As scam crimes are largely conducted by foreign syndicates based overseas who leverage on digital platforms for their operations, police said they would continue to work with foreign law enforcement to crack down on these syndicates. It would also continue to issue scam prevention advisories together with the National Crime Prevention Council.  Police urged the public to exercise caution when making any online transaction, and exercise due diligence to protect themselves from falling victims to scams, as it is often difficult to recover monies that have already been paid or transferred to scammers.  Apart from scams, the first half of the year also saw saw a slight increase of about 5 per cent in the number of molestation cases.

Cases on the public transport system went down but rose at bus interchanges as well as at LRT and MRT stations. The number of molestation cases on public transport went down by 9.8 per cent and police said this could possibly be due to more public awareness and vigilance, stepped-up police patrols and the presence of advisories on buses and trains. However, at bus interchanges and at LRT and MRT stations, the number of molestation cases saw an increase by about 26 per cent – from 30 cases in the first half of last year, to 38 cases in the same period this year.  There was also an increase in the number of molestation cases in shopping malls, from 51 cases in the first half of last year to 67 cases in the same period this year.  The police said it would step up patrols in shopping malls and work with stakeholders to deter such cases, but also reminded the public to stay vigilant while in crowded places.  “Victims of molestation are advised to make a police report as soon as possible. Reporting such crimes early is crucial in helping the police identify and arrest perpetrators,” the police said. "

By impeding fund transfers in this manner, the SPF's two-month-old Anti-Scam Centre aims to disrupt the operations of scammers and minimise the losses of victims. Since it was set up on June 18, about 1,000 police reports relating to e-commerce scams and loan scams have been referred to the centre. So far, 815 bank accounts linked to scams have been frozen, allowing the recovery of 35 per cent - or about $850,000 - of the $2.4 million in losses in total. This would have not been possible previously, as the process to freeze a suspicious bank account used to take about two weeks, said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aileen Yap (DAC), assistant director of the Specialised Commercial Crime Division in the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), who led a team of six officers across various departments in the SPF to set up the Anti-Scam Centre. In addition, the retrieval of bank account holders' details and bank statements for police investigations also used to take about 14 to 60 days. But DBS, OCBC and United Overseas Bank accounts can now be frozen in a few days. The screening of the account holder's details and latest bank balance can also be completed within the same timeframe, while bank statements can be retrieved within five working days. There was a need to set up a centralised unit to tackle the crime, as the types of scams and modus operandi of scammers are constantly evolving, Deputy Superintendent (DSP) Lim Hao Jun from the Criminal Investigation Department's Operation, Investigation Policy and Training Division, told a media briefing on Monday (Aug 26). ""This explains why, in spite of the police's outreach efforts, more people are still falling prey to scams,"" said DSP Lim, who is part of the team of officers who helped set up the centre. ""Our previous efforts for enforcement and outreach have prevented an astronomical rise in scams, but we have to continually rethink on how to deal with this problem,"" he added. As the nerve centre for scam reports, the Anti-Scam Centre will streamline the investigation and prosecution process, and enable the police to intervene as quickly as possible to disrupt scammers' operations, said DSP Lim. This includes working closely with  Last June, the  More recently, in March, the platform introduced machine learning technology to prevent users from creating multiple accounts, as this is one of the ways e-commerce scammers operate, said Carousell's vice-president of operations, Ms Tan Su Lin. This has stopped about 75,000 new accounts from being created, she said. The Anti-Scam Centre will also work with telecommunications companies to terminate mobile lines used by scammers, and find ""effective measures"" to disrupt scammers' operations. In coming up with the Anti-Scam Centre, the team studied similar bodies set up overseas. While police did not reveal which are the overseas centres they studied, there are similar set-ups in Canada, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Social media giant Facebook also recently launched a tool for users to report scam ads in the United Kingdom. The police anti-scam team comprises DAC Yap; DSP Lim; DSP Eric Wong from Police Headquarters; Assistant Superintendent (ASP) Koay Lean Seong, previously from the Commercial Crimes Squad at Central Division; ASP Lim Min Siang from CAD's E-Commerce Fraud Enforcement and Coordination Team; ASP Greg Sim Yi Cheng, a Senior Investigation Officer at CAD; and Commercial Affairs Officer Sharon Xie. A physical centre for the Anti-Scam Centre will be officially launched later this year. "

CT is meted out to repeat offenders who are not eligible for the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. The maximum period for such a sentence is 14 years. Chew Guan Mong, 45, who had been convicted earlier of robbery and housebreaking, pleaded guilty yesterday to 16 charges for a range of offences, including facilitating the retention of criminal conduct, vandalism and being in possession of a weapon. The court was told that Chew was involved in a kidnapping case in which he agreed to collect $80,000 in ransom from the victim's father in 2017. He did so despite having reason to believe that the cash was linked to criminal conduct. Chew roped in another man, Alexander Tay Tong Sing, 23, to collect the cash on Aug 18, 2017. The court heard that the kidnapping case involved a 41-year-old man called Goh Chun Kiat who made plans to illegally flee from Singapore after he was arrested over alleged cheating offences. While out on bail, Goh contacted Malaysian Ng Tak Meng, 33, who is believed to be a member of a human trafficking syndicate, and agreed to pay the younger man $12,000 to facilitate his escape. Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong said that Ng then arranged for six unidentified men to kidnap the Singaporean in Johor Baru and extort a ransom from Goh's family. According to court documents, Goh unlawfully left Singapore by sea on Aug 17, 2017, and was later kidnapped in Malaysia. Chew was then told to collect the $80,000 and, the next day, he directed Tay to meet Goh's father to collect the ransom. The pair then took $1,000 each as their cut and passed the remaining $78,000 to Andrew Yeo Feng Hua, 28, who was sentenced to six months' jail in March for his role in the case. Court documents did not reveal how Goh was released, but he is back in Singapore and is currently facing more than 100 charges, including cheating. In a separate and unrelated case, Chew was driving a rented car along the Pan-Island Expressway at around 1.20pm on Jan 5 last year when it hit a bus, some guard railings and a wall. He got out of the vehicle and ran towards a car driven by a 40-year-old woman. Armed with a sickle, he ordered her to alight and she complied out of fear. Chew then drove to Woodlands Checkpoint in her car and intentionally crashed through a traffic control barrier. He was arrested soon after, the court heard. Chew will be back in court on Sept 17. "

Chew Guan Mong, 45, who had been convicted earlier for robbery and housebreaking, pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Aug 28) to 16 charges for a range of offences including facilitating the retention of criminal conduct, armed robbery, vandalism and being in possession of a weapon. Twenty-five other charges will be considered during sentencing. The court was told that Chew was involved in a kidnapping case in which he agreed to collect $80,000 in ransom from the victim's father in 2017. He did so despite having reason to believe that the cash was linked to criminal conduct. Chew roped in another man, Alexander Tay Tong Sing, 23, to collect the cash on Aug 18, 2017. The court heard that the kidnapping case involved a 41-year-old man called Goh Chun Kiat who made plans to illegally flee from Singapore after he was arrested over alleged cheating offences. While out on bail, Goh contacted Malaysian Ng Tak Meng, 33, who is believed to be a member of a human trafficking syndicate, and agreed to pay the younger man $12,000 to facilitate his escape. Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong said that Ng then arranged for six unidentified men to kidnap the Singaporean in Johor Baru and extort a ransom from Goh's family. According to court documents, Goh unlawfully left Singapore by sea on Aug 17, 2017 and was later kidnapped in Malaysia. Chew was then told to collect the $80,000 and, the next day, he directed Tay to meet Goh's father to collect the ransom. The pair then took $1,000 each as their cut and passed the remaining $78,000 to Andrew Yeo Feng Hua, 28, who was sentenced to six months' jail in March for his role in the case . Court documents did not reveal how Goh was released but he is back in Singapore and is currently facing more than 100 charges including cheating. In a separate and unrelated case, Chew was driving a rented car along the Pan-Island Expressway at around 1.20pm on Jan 5 last year when it hit a bus, some guard railings and a wall. The court heard that he had gone behind the wheel even though he had earlier been disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles. He got out of the vehicle and ran towards a car driven by a 40-year-old woman. Armed with a sickle, he ordered her to alight and she complied out of fear. Chew then drove to the Woodlands Checkpoint in her car but entered a lane for motorcycles by mistake and eventually got stuck. DPP Chong said: ""In his desperation to escape, he intentionally crashed through a traffic control barrier, which is public property belonging to (the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority) causing damage amounting to $6,516.30."" He was arrested soon after, the court heard. On Wednesday, DPP Chong urged District Judge Ng Peng Hong to call for a report to assess Chew's suitability for preventive detention (PD). PD is only for repeat offenders who are above 30 years old. Compared to CT, PD involves a longer period of incarceration, lasting up to 20 years. The cases involving Goh and Tay are pending while Ng is still at large. Chew will be back in court on Sept 17. "

The proposed Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) is an additional payment method being considered for international and domestic arbitration cases, as well as specified proceedings in the Singapore International Commercial Court and mediation cases connected to them. The move is in line with Singapore's aim to be a leading international legal hub, said MinLaw yesterday, adding that the views sought are on the proposal to introduce CFAs and the stated categories of proceedings for which they are intended. A separate study will be done on whether CFAs will promote access to justice for categories of proceedings not being considered currently, it added. Payment under the CFA may include an ""uplift"" or ""success"" fee, in addition to the lawyer's standard legal fees. Existing payment methods will continue alongside the proposed CFA. The traditional methods involve fixed fees or time-based arrangements. Currently, Singapore law prohibits CFAs and contingency fee agreements for lawyers. The ban is rooted in common law derived from England and Wales to protect vulnerable litigants and guard against potential lawyer misconduct. But the two countries have done away with the prohibitions. Several countries, such as Australia, the United States and China, allow such conditional fee agreements in various forms. The proposed framework will contain safeguards such as defining what constitutes a ""successful outcome"" by the parties. Withers KhattarWong managing partner Deborah Barker, a senior counsel, welcomes the ""exciting development"", saying: ""In conditional fee arrangements, the lawyer and law firm will have to decide how much of the agreed risk they are prepared to bear that would otherwise fall on the litigant, and to what extent they are prepared to act on their assessment of the chances of success of the litigation. ""The effect of the conditional fee arrangements on legal practice will depend on the precise scope of the permitted use."" The Law Society's president, Senior Counsel Gregory Vijayendran, said the society will study the proposals and make submissions in due course.

Ms Jonalyn Alvarez Raviz's body had a ligature around the neck which had been tied to a small tree. In an inquiry yesterday into the death of the 34-year-old Filipina, the investigation officer, Assistant Superintendent Desmond Ng, said the police have classified the case as murder and her Bangladeshi husband Raju Dhaly is a suspect. ASP Ng also told State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam that Mr Raju left Singapore for Dhaka on Sept 3 last year and is now at large. The state coroner, who found Ms Raviz's death to be an ""unlawful killing likely perpetrated by her husband"", said the Filipina died of a ""compressive neck injury"". ASP Ng said it could possibly be caused by strangulation. The coroner also said Mr Raju's sudden departure was unexplained and that a warrant for his arrest had been issued. Ms Raviz was employed here as a maid between February 2010 and November 2011 before leaving to work in Hong Kong. Mr Raju, a process maintenance worker, had been working in Singapore since 2007. The pair got married in 2015 and she returned to work as a maid here the following year. Her employer told investigators Ms Raviz had told her she was in an unhappy marriage. Said State Coroner Kamala: ""This was because the husband was abusive and often took away all of her salary. ""Ms Raviz had also informed her employer that she intended to end the marriage as she had caught her husband having extramarital affairs on multiple occasions in the past."" On Sept 2 last year, the Filipina left her employer's Pasir Ris flat around 8.30am. Closed-circuit television footage, which was played in court yesterday, showed her at Pasir Ris Bus Interchange with her husband around 9am. State Coroner Kamala said: ""After meeting her husband, they spent the day together. Ez-link screenings subsequently revealed they had boarded a public bus in the direction of Tampines Road."" Around 5pm, Mr Raju took a taxi from Defu Lane 1 to his dormitory in Jalan Papan near Jurong Port Road. He left the dormitory later that evening, bought a plane ticket to Bangladesh and left Singapore around 5.30am the next day. Ms Raviz's body was found on Sept 6 among some thick vegetation about 5m from the main footpath in Tampines Road. "

The boy and his mother arrived here from China in 1999 when he was about nine years old. She was later repatriated for working illegally in Singapore and the boy eventually moved in with the man. The sexual offences, which first took place in school in 2003, continued in the man's Woodlands flat until 2006. The victim, a Singaporean who is now 30 years old, finally lodged a police report in 2015. Yesterday, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt found the vice-principal, now 57, guilty of three counts of sexually exploiting a minor. The judge also convicted him of five counts of carnal intercourse against the order of nature. The man cannot be named because of a gag order to protect the victim's identity. The Ministry of Education told The Straits Times that he has been suspended from duty since December 2015 and is not deployed at any school. Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew said the victim was a Primary 5 pupil in 2003 and he reported to the man every morning as he was the vice-head prefect. They were in the school gym that year when the man sexually abused the boy. The victim became head prefect in 2004 and accepted the man's offer of English tuition at his flat. The offences continued there. During the trial in March last year, the victim testified that his mother was repatriated around 2002 and he had to live with a relative here. When the relative could no longer be his guardian after his PSLE in 2004, the boy moved in with the vice-principal and his parents, with the man becoming his guardian. The DPP said: ""The victim shared a very good relationship with the accused's father and mother... He also began to regard the accused not just as a mentor, but also as a fatherly figure."" But the man continued with the sexual acts until 2006 and the acts progressed to involve oral sex. In 2013, they went on a trip to Scandinavia and the victim met a woman whom he later married. He moved in with her in Singapore later that year. In 2015, the victim bumped into the vice-principal's niece and told her about his ordeal. She encouraged him to lodge a police report. He decided to contact the man for an out-of-court settlement, asking for $200,000 in compensation. They agreed to meet on Nov 24, 2015, but the victim was instead served with a cease-and-desist order from a lawyer, accusing him of extortion. The victim lodged a police report the next day. The man's bail was set at $15,000. He is set to be sentenced on Sept 24. "

Fellow mastermind Tay Sheng Yang, also 28,  The cases involving two others - Joshua Tan Jun Liang, 28, and Lim Biao, 27 - are pending. Yesterday, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said Ng had played an integral part in the conspiracy which involved the SkillsFuture Credit scheme. The scheme was launched in January 2016 to encourage individuals to take ownership of their skills development and lifelong learning. It gives all Singaporeans aged 25 and older an opening credit of $500 in their SkillsFuture Credit account, which can be used to pay for approved courses. Between February and March 2016, the WDA approved funding under the SkillsFuture Credit scheme for four courses conducted by two companies - A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Tay, who is also known as Allister, was a director of both companies. The courses included programmes on professional selling and financial modelling, with Ng as the only trainer for both companies. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Goh said that in early 2016, Tay and Ng hatched a plan to pay people a fee for getting trainees to register for the courses. When Lim later became involved, the trio talked about giving cash directly to trainees, to increase sales of the courses. Lim later told Tan of the plan, the court heard. Under the SkillsFuture Credit scheme, a training provider cannot pay trainees from the disbursed funds and cannot enter into such agreements, said DPP Goh. In April 2016, a company known as C.G. Marketing (CGM) was formed with the sole purpose of promoting A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. The DPP said Lim and Tan managed CGM's operations and were in charge of recruiting sales staff and paying them commissions. On June 1, 2016, the Commercial Affairs Department received a complaint from the WDA against A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Tay and Ng were arrested at Tuas Checkpoint in separate vehicles on July 25 that year. DPP Goh said Ng made restitution totalling $34,250 to SkillsFuture Singapore on May 31 this year. For each count of cheating, offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

The 41-year-old Indonesian then sprayed insecticide on the victim's face, grabbed the latter's eight-year-old daughter by the hair and pointed a pair of scissors at the girl's throat. She released the child, but threatened her 44-year-old employer with a knife, demanding money and the return of her passport. She then took $200 in cash and two mobile phones worth more than $1,800 in total before fleeing to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, where the police arrested her.

The increase came after the prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by a district judge in March on Tay Wee Kiat, 41, for abusing Ms Moe Moe Than. He had kicked her while she was in a push-up position and had instructed her and the other domestic worker to slap each other, before making both maids worship in front of a Buddhist altar at home, even though one is a Christian and the other is a Muslim. Justice Hoo Sheau Peng agreed with the prosecutors that Tay's initial sentence did not adequately capture his criminality. ""Tay's ill treatment of the victim took place over 11 months. He used implements such as a cane, a broomstick and a metal clothing hook. He caused both physical as well as psychological harm. He also humiliated and demeaned the victim,"" said the judge. Justice Hoo also allowed the prosecution's appeal to reverse the acquittal of Tay's wife - former senior sales manager Chia Yun Ling, 34 - for failing to pay Ms Moe Moe Than's salary amounting to $1,450. Chia was given three months' jail on this charge, which was ordered to run concurrently with her current jail term of 47 months for abusing the Myanmar national. Justice Hoo said Chia's account - that she had paid the maid the outstanding salary a day before her repatriation - was ""unbelievable"". Besides inflicting physical abuse, Chia had force-fed the maid a mixture of rice and sugar through a funnel. When the maid threw up,  Chia has been ordered to pay compensation totalling $9,850 to the two maids, while Tay has been ordered to pay $8,900. Tay told the court yesterday that they are not paying and will serve the default jail terms instead. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan said the prosecution still has the option to seize the couple's assets if compensation is not paid. Tay also asked the court to help facilitate monthly ""tele-visits"" between him and his wife. The couple started serving their jail terms for abusing Ms Moe Moe Than on March 27 this year. Justice Hoo asked the prosecution to check on the request for tele-visits, but noted that it was ultimately up to the prison authorities to make the decision. The couple were first convicted and sentenced in 2017 for abusing their Indonesian maid, Fitriyah, 34. In March last year, following an appeal by the prosecution, Tay's jail term for this set of charges was increased from 28 months to 43 months. Chia's jail term remained at two months. Tay had forced Ms Fitriyah - who goes by one name - to stand on one leg on a stool while holding another stool above her head, with a bottle shoved into her mouth. He had also instructed the two maids to slap each other 10 times, and forced them to bow and get up in front of the altar 100 times. Chia was found guilty of slapping and punching Ms Fitriyah. The sentences imposed on the first set of charges relating to Ms Fitriyah had been stayed, pending the conclusion of the proceedings relating to Ms Moe Moe Than. With the conclusion of the second case yesterday, the court will have to decide on the appropriate date to start the couple's sentences for the first set of charges. "

Financial investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department showed that between Jan 2012 and July 2014, Lien accumulated an unexplained wealth of $258,666.14. These ill-gotten gains were derived from his dealings with Voo. The entire sum was seized by the police at the start of investigations. Lien, who was investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department and Commercial Affairs Department, was jailed for three months - or 12 weeks - on Feb 16, 2017 for helping Voo.

She released the child, but threatened her 44-year-old employer with a knife in demanding some money and the return of her passport. Poniyem then took $200 in cash and two mobile phones worth more than $1,800 in total before fleeing to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, where police arrested her.

The increase came after the prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by a district judge in March on Tay Wee Kiat, 41, on two charges relating to Ms Moe Moe Than. The charges are for kicking Ms Moe Moe Than while she was in a push-up position and for instructing her to slap his other domestic worker, before making both maids worship in front of a Buddhist altar at home, even though one is a Christian and the other a Muslim. Justice Hoo Sheau Peng agreed with prosecutors that Tay's initial sentence did not adequately capture his criminality. ""Tay's ill-treatment of the victim took place over 11 months. He used implements such as a cane, a broomstick and a metal clothing hook. He caused both physical as well as psychological harm. He also humiliated and demeaned the victim,"" said the judge. Justice Hoo also allowed the prosecution's appeal to reverse the acquittal of Tay's wife - former senior sales manager Chia Yun Ling, 34 - on a charge of failing to pay Ms Moe Moe Than's salary amounting to $1,450. Chia was sentenced to three months' jail on this charge, which was ordered to run concurrently with her current jail term of 47 months for abusing the 28-year-old Myanmar national. Justice Hoo said Chia's account that she had paid the maid the outstanding salary a day before the victim's repatriation, was ""unbelievable"". Besides inflicting physical abuse on Ms Moe Moe Than, Chia had force-fed the maid a mixture of rice and sugar through a funnel. When the maid threw up as a result,  She had also forced the maid to do her chores without a blouse on and threatened to kill her family if she told anyone about the ill-treatment. Chia has been ordered to pay compensation totalling $9,850 to the two maids, while Tay has been ordered to pay $8,900. Tay told the court on Monday that they will be defaulting on payment and will choose to serve jail terms in lieu of compensating the two maids. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan highlighted in court that it remains an option for the prosecution to seize the couple's assets if payment is not made. Tay also asked the court to help facilitate monthly ""tele-visits"" between him and his wife. The couple started serving their jail terms for abusing Ms Moe Moe Than on March 27 this year. Justice Hoo asked the prosecution to check on this, but noted that it was ultimately up to the prison authorities to make the decision. The couple were first convicted and sentenced in 2017 for abusing their Indonesian maid, Fitriyah, 34. In March 2018, following an appeal by the prosecution, Tay's jail term for this set of charges was increased from 28 months to 43 months by a three-judge High Court panel. Chia's jail term remained at two months. Among other things, Tay had forced Ms Fitriyah to stand on one leg on a stool while holding another stool above her head, with a plastic bottle shoved into her mouth. He had also instructed the two maids to slap each other 10 times, and forced them to bow and get up in front of the altar 100 times, after blaming them for moving a piece of cloth on the table. Chia was found guilty of slapping and punching Ms Fitriyah. The sentences imposed on the first set of charges relating to Ms Fitriyah had been stayed, pending the conclusion of the proceedings relating to Ms Moe Moe Than. With the conclusion of the second case on Monday, the court will have to decide what is the appropriate date to start the couple's sentences for the first set of abuse charges.  That means it is possible, for instance, that Tay be ordered to serve his 43-month jail term for abusing Ms Fitriyah after the expiry of his 30-month term for abusing Ms Moe Moe Than. It is also possible that the two terms may be ordered to run concurrently. "

The offences were committed against the WDA, now known as SkillsFuture Singapore, in 2016. Ng Yong Jing had on Aug 14 Another 187 charges involving the remaining sum were considered during sentencing. Fellow mastermind, Tay Sheng Yang, also 28,  The cases involving two others - Joshua Tan Jun Liang, 28, and Lim Biao, 27 - are pending. District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan on Monday said that Ng had played an integral part in the conspiracy which involved the SkillsFuture Credits (SFC) scheme. The scheme was launched in January 2016 to encourage individuals to take ownership of their skills development and lifelong learning. It gives all Singaporeans aged 25 and older an opening credit of $500 in their SFC account, which can be used to pay for approved courses. Between February and March 2016, the WDA approved funding under the SFC scheme of four courses conducted by two companies - A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Tay, who is also known as Allister, was a director of both companies. The courses included programmes on professional selling and financial modelling, with Ng as the only trainer for both companies. But Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Goh said that in early 2016, Tay and Ng hatched a plan to pay people a fee for getting trainees to register for the courses. When Lim later became involved, the trio talked about giving cash directly to trainees, to increase sales of the courses. Lim later told Tan of the plan, the court heard. Under the SFC scheme, a training provider cannot pay trainees from the disbursed funds, and cannot enter into such agreements, said DPP Goh. In April 2016, a company known as C.G. Marketing (CGM) was formed with the sole purpose of promoting A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. The DPP said Lim and Tan managed CGM's operations and were in charge of recruiting sales persons and paying them commissions. She added: ""Sean, Lim Biao, Joshua and Allister initiated a plan to cheat WDA by submitting inflated SFC claims. ""By having CGM give cashbacks for course registration, the plan encouraged a high sign-up rate for courses offered by A.I. Industries without trainees actually attending the courses. ""As a result, the WDA was cheated into delivering a total of $51,000 to A.I. Industries."" On June 1, 2016, the Commercial Affairs Department received a complaint from the WDA against A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. The WDA removed the two companies' courses from the SFC course directory a week later. Tay and Ng were arrested at the Tuas Checkpoint in separate vehicles on July 25, 2016, DPP Goh said Ng made a restitution totalling $34,250 to SkillsFuture Singapore on May 31 this year. For each count of cheating, offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

As a result of the offences, Lau Pin Lin and her then boss Liu Mei Ying made 14 successful bogus claims totalling more than $64,000. Lau, 42, pleaded guilty to two offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. She also admitted to one count each of cheating and falsification of accounts. The court heard that Liu, 55, was the sole director of Derma Flora Beauty Academy and Derma Flora Beauty. She was also the sole proprietor of Beaux Ex Bellus Trading. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew said that, collectively, these firms were known as the Derma Flora Group. Lau, who worked for Derma Flora Beauty Academy and Derma Flora Beauty, resigned in October 2013. Liu's cases are still pending. The two companies were training providers, conducting beauty and body treatment courses that had been approved under WDA's funding for the Employer-based Training Scheme. The initiative aimed to encourage employers to upgrade their workers' skills by defraying their costs in doing so. The DPP added that Derma Flora Beauty and Beaux Ex Bellus Trading were ""applicant companies"" that had also applied for WDA funding under the scheme. Court documents said applicant companies were firms that could apply for training grants to fund their employees' participation in courses run by approved training providers. DPP Yew said that between December 2011 and July 2013, Lau acted on Liu's instructions and accessed SkillsConnect - an online portal hosted on WDA's server - to submit false information to the agency. WDA was told, among other things, that trainees sent for courses by Derma Flora Beauty and Beaux Ex Bellus Trading were employees of the two firms when there were, in fact, no such workers. As a result, 14 successful fraudulent claims were made totalling more than $64,000. The DPP told District Judge Kessler Soh: ""Lau was never intended to receive any direct financial benefit nor did she receive any direct financial benefit from her participation in the scams."" The offences came to light in July 2013 when WDA conducted an audit on the Derma Flora Group. Lau then contacted the agency and the Committee for Private Education later that year, telling them about the fraudulent attendance records. On April 1, 2014, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received a complaint from WDA against the Derma Flora Group about the fraudulent training grant claims.

Madam Lim Choo Eng's husband died in 2012 when a Ferrari crashed into his taxi and she used some of the money she received after his death to invest in a plot of land in China, giving it to Madam Koh Siew Eng - including a $50,000 deposit. When she realised she had been tricked, she tried to sue Madam Koh for a refund - but Madam Koh contended that she was just a ""mouthpiece"" facilitating the transaction and had transferred the money to a third party in China who granted Madam Lim a sublease for the plot. In a judgment yesterday, a High Court judge dismissed Madam Lim's case, even though he found she was honest and he believed her testimony more than Madam Koh's. Justice Choo Han Teck said Madam Lim's claim for misrepresentation must fail as she had not pleaded that there was a contract, oral or written, between her and Madam Koh. ""Although it seems to me that Lim appeared to have acted in reliance on Koh's representation, and might even have come to an agreement with her, none of that was pleaded and the court cannot write their contract for them."" Justice Choo will hear arguments on costs at a later date, but said he did not think Madam Lim should have to bear any legal costs for the case. Madam Lim's husband, Mr Cheng Teck Hock, died after a speeding Ferrari ran a red light at more than 170kmh and smashed into his taxi in Rochor Road. The Ferrari driver Ma Chi also died, along with a passenger in the taxi. Mr Ma's insurers offered payouts while public donations poured in for Mr Cheng's family. In 2014, Madam Lim decided to invest some money through Madam Koh. The two women became acquainted through their sons, who were friends. Madam Lim said Madam Koh claimed to be a successful investor and offered her a joint investment opportunity to buy land in China which was to be redeveloped and sold for profit. Between March and August 2014, Madam Lim transferred more than $280,000 to Madam Koh and Madam Koh's sister. In August 2014, Madam Lim and Madam Koh flew to China to meet Mr Lu Jinlin, who was supposed to lease the land from a village committee. He did not show Madam Lim the land because of ""bad weather"" but she was assured by Mr Lu and Madam Koh that she would get a stake. In March 2015, Mr Lu came to Singapore and signed a document granting Madam Lim a 70-year sublease for part of the land. Madam Lim did not get any more information about the deal and said it was only in 2017 that she realised Madam Koh did not invest in it. Madam Koh said Madam Lim was always aware that she was only an agent; she denied having made claims about a joint investment. She said the money was transferred to Mr Lu and his family between April 2014 and October 2016. Madam Lim's lawyer, Mr Renganathan Shankar, argued that Madam Koh had orchestrated the entire scheme as she was aware of Madam Lim's finances. He argued that Madam Lim was entitled to rescind the contract or to damages. But Justice Choo said Madam Koh was not a party to the sublease, a contract between Madam Lim and Mr Lu. The judge added that the sublease was ""highly suspect"". Unfortunately, the authenticity of the document was not challenged, nor did Madam Lim check with the land owners as to whether her sublease was recognised. "

In her findings into the death of 38-year-old Sats officer Mohamad Fadli Mohd Saleh, she noted that seven of the 34 food handlers at the eatery were not registered with the National Environment Agency (NEA). This means that they had not attended the basic food hygiene course. The State Coroner ruled Mr Mohamad Fadli's death an ""unfortunate misadventure"". She said that the premises of the Spize outlet, where the bento set was prepared, were found to contain strains of salmonella. Faecal matter was also detected in some belacan egg fried rice as well as on kitchen tools such as a chopping board and a knife. ""In addition to the lapses in hygiene, it was discovered that unlicensed premises on level two of the Spize restaurant were used for the preparation of raw vegetables,"" said State Coroner Kamala. She said that 88 bento sets were prepared at Spize's River Valley outlet between 9.30am and 10.30am on Nov 6 last year. Fifty-seven of them were then taken to the Kaki Bukit office of Brink's Singapore, a security company, for a Deepavali celebration, and the food arrived there around 11.30am. An invoice from the eatery stated that the food had to be eaten within an hour of delivery ""to guarantee freshness"". The invoice also stated that Spize would not be liable for the health of those who consumed the food beyond the recommended time. Mr Mohamad Fadli, a father of two, attended the gathering as he had been deployed to Brink's Singapore, though the event itself did not involve Sats. The State Coroner said that he ate the food after 2.53pm, fell sick and was taken to hospital on Nov 8, two days after he had consumed the food. Six days later, he died of sepsis and multiple organ failure after suffering acute gastroenteritis. There were seven food poisoning incidents in total linked to Spize's River Valley outlet between Nov 6 and 9 last year. Of the 221 people who consumed food prepared there during this period, 82 reported falling ill. A joint inspection of the eatery on Nov 14 that year by the NEA, the Ministry of Health as well as the then Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore revealed lapses which included preparing food outside the licensed kitchen area. The NEA terminated the operating licences of the Spize restaurant in River Valley Road last December. "

In a statement on Friday night (Aug 23), SPS said the articles had been written in Pannir's name by someone else. ""This appears to be part of an orchestrated campaign to put pressure on the Singapore Government,"" SPS said. ""SPS will investigate further the circumstances relating to this matter,"" it added. Pannir is fighting the rejection of his clemency plea by President Halimah Yacob. Malaysian news site Malay Mail had published on Aug 19 a first-person account of life in prison said to be written by Pannir. It claimed that he was subjected to ""psychological torture,"" locked up in a very hot room with the lights on for two weeks. In the article, the author described being denied the right to be baptised, and said the treatment in prison reminded him of stories that he had read of Nazi concentration camps. The same newspaper had published another letter purportedly written by Pannir on Aug 15, detailing his thoughts and goals while in prison. Pannir was convicted of importing 51.84g of heroin in 2017, and was due to be hanged in May this year. His clemency petition to President Halimah Yacob was rejected in the same month, but he received a stay of execution after he declared his intention to mount a legal challenge against the decision. Subsequently, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam revealed that his Malaysian counterpart had written to the Singapore Government over the case. Mr Shanmugam said it was one of three requests made by the Pakatan Harapan government to stop the execution of Malaysians in Singapore since it took power after the election in May last year. But Singapore cannot make exceptions for Malaysians who have been sentenced to death as it would undermine the rule of law here, Mr Shanmugam explained. The Singapore Government will not intervene when the courts have already imposed a sentence and there are no legal reasons to do so, he added. ""It is not tenable to give a special moratorium to Malaysians, and impose it on everyone else, including Singaporeans who commit offences which carry the death penalty,"" said Mr Shanmugam. As at end July, Pannir's application for permission to start judicial review proceedings is pending before the High Court. "

As a result of the offences, Lau Pin Lin and her then-boss Liu Mei Ying made 14 successful bogus claims totalling more than $64,000. Lau, 42, pleaded guilty to two offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. She also admitted to one count each of cheating and falsification of accounts. The court heard that Liu, 55, was the sole director of Derma Flora Beauty Academy and Derma Flora Beauty. She was also the sole proprietor of Beaux Ex Bellus Trading. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew said that, collectively, these firms were known as the Derma Flora Group. Lau, who worked for Derma Flora Beauty Academy and Derma Flora Beauty, resigned in October 2013. Liu's cases are still pending. The two companies were training providers conducting beauty and body treatment courses that had been approved under WDA's Funding for Employer-based Training Scheme. The initiative aimed to encourage employers to upgrade their workers' skills by defraying their costs in doing so. The DPP added that Derma Flora Beauty and Beaux Ex Bellus Trading were ""applicant companies"" that had also applied for WDA funding under the scheme. Court documents said applicant companies were firms that could apply for training grants to fund their employees' participation in courses run by approved training providers. DPP Yew said that between December 2011 and July 2013, Lau acted on Liu's instructions and accessed SkillsConnect - an online portal hosted on WDA's server - to submit false information to the agency. WDA was, among other things, told that trainees sent for courses by Derma Flora Beauty and Beaux Ex Bellus Trading were employees of the two firms when there were, in fact, no such workers. As a result, 14 successful fraudulent claims were made totalling more than $64,000. The DPP told District Judge Kessler Soh: ""Lau was never intended to receive any direct financial benefit nor did she receive any direct financial benefit from her participation in the scams."" The offences came to light in July 2013 when WDA conducted an audit on the Derma Flora Group. Lau then contacted the agency and the Committee for Private Education later that year, telling them about the fraudulent attendance records. On April 1, 2014, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received a complaint from WDA against the Derma Flora Group about the fraudulent training grant claims. Lau came clean about what she had done during CAD's investigations. The DPP urged Judge Soh to sentence her to at least four months' jail, stressing that her offences involved a public institution. Defence lawyer Rakesh Vasu, however, pleaded for his client to be given a high fine and said that Liu had taken advantage of Lau's vulnerability. Lau is now out on bail of $15,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Sept 13. For falsifying accounts, offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

Muhamad Aidith Abdul Latiff, 44, who was from CAL Academy, is said to have duped each alleged victim into handing over sums that ranged from about $1,000 to more than $1.5 million in a scheme that promised investors a 97 per cent return on their investments. The Singaporean allegedly cheated them between February and August 2016. He is also accused of unlawfully transporting cash in and out of Singapore. Between June 2015 and March 2016, Aidith is said to have repeatedly smuggled through the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints cash of between $30,000 and $50,000, exceeding the allowed limit of $20,000. He was charged yesterday with 29 counts of cheating and 26 counts of failing to declare cross-border movement of cash. In a statement, the police said that between April 2015 and August 2016, officers received several reports from people who were allegedly cheated by a man who promoted the investment scheme. The police have advised the public to avoid investments that promise high returns, guaranteed profits and quick gains - especially when there are claims that they involve little or no risk. They said that before committing to an investment, people should ask as many questions as they need to fully understand the investment opportunity and check on the company, its owners, directors and management members to assess if the offer is genuine. The police have also advised the public to confirm the credentials of both the company and its representatives through resources such as the Financial Institutions Directory. Aidith, who was unrepresented, told the court yesterday that he intends to engage a lawyer. He is now out on bail of $80,000 and will be back in court on Sept 12.

The court heard that the 14-year-old girl felt ""embarrassed and scared"" but burst out laughing as she was unsure how to react. Later that evening, he kissed her lips again on a staircase and the girl felt ""speechless"" after this. She later told another teacher about the incident on July 28 last year and the police were alerted. The 35-year-old secondary school teacher pleaded guilty on Tuesday to committing an indecent act on the minor. He cannot be named as the court imposed a gag order to protect the girl's identity. In a statement on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education told The Straits Times that the teacher has been suspended since last September and is no longer at the school. The court heard that the man taught at a local school where he was in charge of the girl's co-curricular activity (CCA). The name of the school and the CCA were redacted from court documents seen by The Straits Times. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Tan said that before committing the offence, the teacher had been exchanging text messages with the girl. They had also gone out together on two earlier occasions, for a haircut on July 18 last year and, six days later, met at a shopping mall to have tea. On July 28 last year, the teacher was a chaperone for a school outing and he accompanied the girl and her schoolmates to watch a play. When the show ended, he asked her out to dinner and she accepted his invitation. DPP Tan told District Judge Salina Ishak: ""After they finished dinner, the accused asked the victim to sit next to him. The victim complied. ""When the victim sat next to the accused, the accused placed his right arm over the victim's shoulder. The accused then leaned towards the victim and kissed the victim on her lips. The victim was shocked and nervous."" After they left the restaurant, the girl told him that she wanted to go home as it was late. They were walking up a flight of stairs when he called out to her. She turned around and he kissed her again on her lips. After that, they took a bus to her father's home before parting ways. The man was offered bail of $10,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Sept 3. First-time offenders convicted of committing an indecent act on a minor can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $20,000. "

Christina Cheong Yoke Lin, a part-time English teacher, had allowed a love scammer to use her bank account to retain the $50,030 his victim had transferred over. She later decided to keep $50,000 for herself. For dishonestly misappropriating the money, the 63-year-old was yesterday sentenced to an 18-month mandatory treatment order in lieu of jail time. Cheong had been found to be suffering from a major depressive disorder when she committed the offence. The court heard that Cheong, who pleaded guilty in May, met a man, known only as Collins, through online dating platform Badoo in early August 2017. When she told him that she was in debt, he asked if she would allow his boss' associates to make use of her bank accounts. The court heard that Collins had explained that Cheong could take $500 out of each transaction but she was to take the rest of the money to Johor Baru. Cheong agreed to give the arrangement a try. On Aug 17, 2017, the victim of a love scam transferred $50,030 to Cheong's bank account. Collins then told Cheong to pass $50,000 to one of his boss' associates. Instead, she decided to keep the money. But love came calling, and on Aug 21, 2017, Cheong transferred $31,000 to a Malaysian bank account, to help another man she was smitten with. However, the man, known only as Mark Anthony, was also a scammer. He convinced Cheong that he needed the money because he was purportedly detained by the Malaysian authorities. Cheong was caught after the Singaporean woman linked to Collins' love scam alerted the police on Sept 22 that year. It is unclear what happened to the online Casanovas, but Cheong has since made full restitution. In sentencing Cheong, District Judge Ng Peng Hong said that ""rehabilitation outweighs retribution and deterrence"" in this case. The prosecution will be filing an appeal against the sentence. For dishonestly misappropriating the money, Cheong could have been jailed for up to two years and fined. "

Ms Angelina Jiang said Mr Toh Eng Tiah, 55, was unwilling to give his wife shares in his paper recycling company upon their divorce. ""He needed the contract to show her that he did not love me more than her,"" she told the High Court. She was testifying on the fourth day of the hearing into Mr Toh's suit to get back the $2 million that he had paid her between December 2016 and March 2017. Mr Toh, who owns three recycling companies, says the money was a loan. Ms Jiang says it was a gift. Both sides signed a loan agreement for $2 million on March 24, 2017, after Mr Toh had already paid Ms Jiang an advance of more than $1 million. He then paid her another $872,000. Ms Jiang said Mr Toh had suggested that they sign the agreement as a ploy to placate his wife, who had found out that he had given large sums of money to Ms Jiang. She said Mr Toh wanted to show his wife the document to make her believe he had only lent Ms Jiang the money, which would be repaid. Yesterday, Mr Toh's lawyer Anthony Lee said this did not make sense, given Ms Jiang's testimony that the businessman was about to divorce his wife. He said there was no reason that Mr Toh would have to appease his wife, as they were about to divorce. Ms Jiang disagreed. She said the ""fake contract"" was to be shown to Mr Toh's wife so that she would not insist on getting shares in his company in their divorce. Mr Toh wanted to show that giving his wife $3 million and two properties for a childless marriage was ""good enough"", said Ms Jiang. She said that Mr Toh had promised not to enforce the contract or sue her for the money. He even suggested that to make the ploy look realistic, they should each engage their own lawyers to witness the signing, she added. Ms Jiang said Mr Toh had told her the contract had to be signed before March 31, 2017, the day he was negotiating the divorce with his wife. Mr Toh earlier testified that he and Ms Jiang had met divorce lawyers on Jan 31, 2017, but he had no intention of divorcing his wife. Yesterday, Ms Jiang also accused Mr Toh's wife, Ms Chong Lee Yee, of fabricating evidence. Ms Chong had produced photos of text messages between Mr Toh and Ms Jiang that she said she had secretly taken off her husband's phone. But Ms Jiang said 95 per cent of the messages were not from her and that many photos did not show her WeChat avatar and name, or the date and time of the messages. Comparing the photos with her own records, she pointed out discrepancies and formatting differences. The trial continues next month. "

Lye Wai Choong, 60, is accused of filing incorrect tax returns, including three counts of understating the income of the Centre for Kidney Diseases, where he is a director. According to court papers seen by The Straits Times, his actions allegedly resulted in around $1.44 million in undercharged taxes. The Centre for Kidney diseases is a private clinic in Orchard Road, offering specialised medical services. Lye is also a renal physician at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. In 2008, he and four other doctors successfully performed a high-risk operation transplanting a kidney into a patient of a different blood type from the donor. Formerly the president of the Society of Transplantation in Singapore, Lye was charged on July 5 with making incorrect returns without an excuse by understating the centre's income in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The centre took in more than $2 million in 2013 and in 2015, and more than $1.9 million in 2014. This resulted in a total of about $1.02 million in undercharged taxes. The doctor also faces 12 charges of making incorrect goods and services tax returns without a reasonable excuse from 2011 to 2014 on behalf of the centre as its director, resulting in almost $420,000 in undercharged taxes. If found guilty, he may have to pay double the amount of undercharged tax, and may also be fined up to $5,000, jailed for up to three years, or both. In a separate case, the director of IT company Orynix, Arthur Yeo, was charged on May 24 with tax offences committed in 2012, which resulted in more than $77,000 in undercharged taxes. If found guilty, he will have to pay thrice the amount of the undercharged tax, and may be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to seven years, or both. "

Ms Angelina Jiang said Mr Toh Eng Tiah, 55, was not willing to give his wife shares in his paper recycling company upon their divorce. ""He needed the contract to show her that he did not love me more than her,"" she told the High Court. She was testifying on the fourth day of the hearing into Mr Toh's suit to get back $2 million he paid her between December 2016 and March 2017. Mr Toh, who owns three recycling companies, says the money was a loan, while Ms Jiang says it was a gift. Both sides signed a loan agreement for $2 million on March 24, 2017, after Mr Toh had already advanced more than $1 million to her. He then paid her another $872,000. Ms Jiang said Mr Toh suggested that they sign the agreement as a ""ploy"" to placate his wife, who had found out that he gave large sums of money to Ms Jiang. She said Mr Toh wanted to show the document to his wife to make her believe he had only lent Ms Jiang the money, which would be repaid. On Thursday, Mr Toh's lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, said this did not make sense, given Ms Jiang's testimony that the businessman was about to divorce his wife. ""There is no reason for Mr Toh to have to appease his wife because he was about to divorce his wife,"" he said. Ms Jiang disagreed. She said the ""fake contract"" was to be shown to Mr Toh's wife so that she would not insist on getting shares in his company in their divorce. Mr Toh wanted to show that giving his wife $3 million and two properties for a childless marriage was ""good enough"", said Ms Jiang. She said Mr Toh promised not to enforce the contract or sue her for the money. Mr Toh even suggested that to make the ploy look realistic, each of them should engage their own lawyers to witness the signing, said Ms Jiang. She said he told her the contract had to be signed before March 31, the day he was negotiating the divorce with his wife. Mr Toh earlier testified that he had gone with Ms Jiang to meet divorce lawyers on Jan 31, 2017, but he had no intention of divorcing his wife. On Thursday, Ms Jiang also accused Mr Toh's wife, Ms Chong Lee Yee, of fabricating evidence. Ms Chong had produced photos of text messages between Mr Toh and Ms Jiang that she said she had secretly taken off her husband's phone. But Ms Jiang said 95 per cent of the messages were not sent by her. She noted that many photos did not show her Wechat avatar and name, nor the date and time of the messages. Comparing the photos with her own records, she also pointed out discrepancies and formatting differences. The trial continues in September. "

In a statement, police said that between April 2015 and August 2016, officers received several reports from people who were allegedly cheated by a man who promoted the investment scheme. Police have advised the public to avoid investments that promise high returns, guaranteed profits and quick gains - especially when there are claims that the investments involve little or no risk. They said that before committing to an investment, people should ask as many questions as they need to fully understand the investment opportunity as well as check on the company, its owners, directors and management members to assess if the offer is genuine. Police also advise the public to confirm the credentials of both the company and its representatives through resources such as the Financial Institutions Directory.

Later that evening, he kissed her lips again on a staircase and the girl felt ""speechless"" after this. She later told another teacher about the incident on July 28 last year and the police were alerted. The 35-year-old secondary school teacher pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Aug 20) to committing an indecent act on the minor. He cannot be named as the court imposed a gag order to protect the girl's identity. In a statement on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education (MOE) told The Straits Times that the teacher has been suspended since last September and is no longer at the school. The court heard that the man taught at a local school where he was in charge of the girl's co-curricular activity (CCA). Details such as the name of the school and the CCA were redacted from court documents seen by The Straits Times. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Tan said that before committing the offence, the teacher had been exchanging text messages with the girl. They had also gone out together on two earlier occasions, for a haircut on July 18 last year and six days later, they met at a shopping mall to have tea. On July 28 last year, the teacher was a chaperone for a school outing and he accompanied the girl as well as her schoolmates to watch a play. When the show ended, he asked her out to dinner and she accepted his invitation. DPP Tan told District Judge Salina Ishak: ""After they finished dinner, the accused asked the victim to sit next to him. The victim complied. ""When the victim sat next to the accused, the accused placed his right arm over the victim's shoulder. The accused then leaned towards the victim and kissed the victim on her lips. The victim was shocked and nervous."" After they left the restaurant, the girl told him that she wanted to go home as it was late. The pair were walking up a flight of stairs when he called out to her. She turned around and he kissed her again on her lips. After that, they took a bus to her father's home before parting ways. The man was offered bail of $10,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Sept 3. MOE has said that all educators are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the profession and the trust placed in them. The spokesman said: ""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service."" First-time offenders convicted of committing an indecent act on a minor can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $20,000. "

Cheong had been found to be suffering from a major depressive disorder when she committed the offence. The court heard that Cheong, who pleaded guilty in May, met a man known only as Collins through online dating platform Badoo in early August 2017. When she told him that she was in debt, he asked if she would allow his boss' associates to make use of her bank accounts. The court heard that Collins had explained that she could take $500 out of each transaction but she was to take the rest of the money to Johor Baru. Cheong expressed concerns. She was worried that she would get into trouble for carrying the money into Malaysia, and also wondered why the money could not be paid directly into the bank account of Collins' boss. However, she agreed to give the arrangement a try. On Aug 17, 2017, the 54-year-old victim of a love scam transferred $50,030 to Cheong's bank account. Collins then told Cheong to pass $50,000 to one of his boss' associates. Instead she decided to keep the money. But love came calling and on Aug 21, 2017, Cheong transferred $31,000 to a Malaysian bank account to help another man she was smitten with. However, the man, known only as Mark Anthony, was also a scammer. He had convinced Cheong that he needed the money because he was purportedly detained by the Malaysian authorities. Cheong was caught after the Singaporean woman linked to Collins' love scam alerted the police on Sept 22 that year.

A district court heard yesterday that three men working at the home were also assaulted. A 44-year-old auxiliary police officer was injured in one eye that most likely would be permanently damaged. A 33-year-old youth guidance officer and the home's 45-year-old assistant manager suffered head injuries. The rioters cannot be named, owing to a gag order by the court, so The Straits Times will identify the trio, who were convicted yesterday, as A, B and C. Each of them pleaded guilty to a rioting charge and two counts of vandalism. They were the first ones to be convicted at the State Courts for participating in the riot. The court heard that the trio were sent to the home in Jurong West after they committed a range of offences, including theft. On Sept 26 last year, there was a shouting match among the inmates of the home and the teenagers were placed on lockdown for the entire day. They were not allowed to leave their dormitories apart from attending classes. Said Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh: ""They were angry with the punishment imposed and started discussing a plan to riot, through the grilles of their adjacent dormitories. During the discussion, it was suggested the group carry out 'armour bang', a common term for the banging of items in dormitories and causing damage."" The inmates were informed later in the evening that they would no longer be on lockdown the following day. But on Sept 28, two days after the lockdown, one of the inmates became restless during yard time. He gathered the others, including the trio, and told them of his plan to proceed with the ""armour bang"". They agreed to riot during fall-in time as this was when everyone would be gathered together. Around 5.50pm, the youth guidance officer called for everyone to fall in at the home's courtyard. As planned, A and a 15-year-old boy started a fake argument and A challenged the younger teen to a fight. When the officer tried to separate them, the 15-year-old punched the man's face, and the other teens, including the trio, joined the attack. The assistant manager and the auxiliary police officer, who tried to help the man, were also attacked by the teens. The DPP said C used a floorball stick to hit the assistant manager in the back of his head. A struck the auxiliary police officer's head with a similar stick multiple times. The injured adults eventually fled the scene. The trio and four other rioters also took turns to damage property at the home, including a wall-mounted television set and two bookshelves. Four more teens later joined the group. The police were called, said DPP Koh, adding: ""The group... broke into song and shouted loudly while waiting for the police to apprehend them."" The court has called for reports to assess the teenagers' suitability for reformative training, which involves a strict regimen that includes foot drills and counselling. A and C will be back in court next week. B's case has been adjourned to next month. "

Fong Leok Moy, 68, and Wong Phuay Yee, 41 - who were both jobless at the time - each pleaded guilty yesterday to three shoplifting charges and were sentenced to 10 days in jail. Each woman had seven other theft charges taken into consideration during sentencing.

Mr Toh's lawyer accused Ms Angelina Jiang of telling untruths, saying it was unbelievable that a man in his 50s would make these vows after less than a month of intimacy. She replied that Mr Toh told her he had stomach cancer and was living each day as though it were his last. ""He wanted a happy life with me. I was the woman in his heart,"" she said. Ms Jiang was taking the stand on the third day of the hearing into Mr Toh's High Court suit to get back $2 million he had paid her between December 2016 and March 2017. Mr Toh, who was indeed ill at the time, says the money was a loan that had to be repaid, while Ms Jiang says it was a gift. Ms Jiang said Mr Toh pursued her after they met in November 2016 when he responded to a newspaper advertisement she had placed to sell a shophouse that she owned in Thomson. They began a relationship the following month, despite her initial reluctance to get involved with a married man, she said. On Dec 19, 2016, Mr Toh signed an agreement to lend her $200,000 to buy a Balestier shophouse. Ms Jiang said they had sex for the first time that day, after which Mr Toh tore up his copy of the agreement and waived the loan. She said that on Jan 12, 2017, Mr Toh made several vows at the temple, promising to buy a house for her, set up home with her and support her financially. Mr Toh's lawyer Anthony Lee attacked Ms Jiang's character in cross-examination, earning several objections from her lawyer, Mr Mahesh Rai. Justice Andrew Ang shut down a few lines of questioning. The judge noted that Ms Jiang's motives were not relevant to the case; what was relevant was whether Mr Toh had parted with his money by way of a gift or a loan. Mr Lee had asked the China-born Ms Jiang, who became a Singapore citizen in 2014, to produce her identity card, asking why she had changed her name from Angelina to Victoria and back to Angelina. She said she changed her name to Victoria to get a new start as she was involved in ""many things"" but changed it back on July 30 this year because of the lawsuit. Mr Lee also grilled Ms Jiang, a graduate of Southwest University of Political Science and Law in her native Chongqing, on her sources of income. In 2016, she was a manager at a construction company earning $8,000 a month while selling property part time. She said she also had income from introducing friends to study in Singapore and to buy property and insurance. Mr Lee said the sums did not add up to her declared income for that year of more than $700,000. He suggested that she had falsely overstated her income so that she could obtain bank loans to buy property. She disagreed. Mr Lee also told the court that in December 2016, Ms Jiang owed $675,000 to seven banks in unsecured loans. Mr Toh's wife, Ms Chong Lee Yee, also took the stand yesterday to testify for him. She said she found out in March 2017 that her husband had paid sums of money to Ms Jiang and asked him to demand repayment. ""I told my husband: This woman is out to cheat you,"" she said. She produced numerous photos of chat messages between Mr Toh and Ms Jiang. She said she had secretly taken them from her husband's phone. She said the photos included nude pictures Ms Jiang had taken to ""seduce"" her husband, but the judge said it was not necessary to show them to the court. "

Yeo Wee Soon, who pleaded guilty to the charge, bought the poodle named To-Bi online about a week before the abuse occurred. On Feb 6 last year, Yeo, 41, was washing To-Bi, whose fur was smeared with faeces. The dog struggled and Yeo ""tapped"" it twice to discipline it, said National Parks Board prosecutor Packer Mohammad. When the dog responded by biting Yeo's finger, he ""tapped"" it harder the third time and it collapsed. He tried to revive the dog by hitting its head against the bathtub twice. He then put To-Bi in ice water and showered it in cold water, added Mr Packer. The dog became motionless. Yeo put To-Bi in a pail and dropped it into the river along Delta Avenue, the court heard. <strong>He tried to revive the dog by hitting its head against the bathtub twice.</strong> <strong>He then put To-Bi in ice water and showered it in cold water.</strong> ""The action was unreasonable and led to the unnecessary death of the dog,"" Mr Packer added. Action was taken against Yeo after his parents heard To-Bi wailing and saw their son taking a pail out of the house and returning without it.

Residents at the Spottiswoode 18 condominium told The Straits Times that the police showed them a picture of an Italian wine bottle and asked if they had been drinking wine and were willing to provide fingerprint samples. Resident Jeremy Tan, 30, said the police visited his home on Tuesday night to ask if he drank wine or knew of troublemakers in the area. ""They showed us a picture of an Italian wine bottle and asked if we were willing to provide biometric samples if called upon,"" added Mr Tan, who runs a skincare distribution business. He said it seemed unlikely the bottle fell accidentally from a flat as the balconies of the apartments in the block are not directly above the barbecue pit area, where Mr Nasiari Sunee collapsed after being hit by a bottle. The grandfather of nine was at the condominium for a relative's housewarming party on Sunday when the bottle struck the top of his head, ricocheted and hit his 69-year-old wife. He was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he died on Monday morning. Residents told The Straits Times there are overhangs that would obstruct items falling from a balcony from reaching the barbecue area, including a small ledge that extends out of each balcony. Mr Liam O'Neill, 30, a personal trainer, said the barbecue pit is ""just too far away"" from the balconies of the flats, adding that it was the first time he has heard of such an incident at the condominium. Residents also said that it would be difficult to identify the culprit even if the police checked the bottle for fingerprints. Glass bottles are often left next to the rubbish chute on every floor, as the building's management had asked residents to do so to prevent glass shattering in the chute. ""Someone could have taken a bottle from near the chute and dropped it, but the original owner's fingerprints would still be on it,"" a woman in her 30s said yesterday. Residents had complained about high-rise littering, she added, but they were mainly about small items like cigarette butts. While litterbugs who throw small items such as cigarette butts or tissue paper could be punished under the Environmental Public Health Act with a fine and/or Corrective Work Order, those who throw bigger items that endanger lives could face criminal charges, said lawyers. Lawyer Rajan Supramaniam said that even if the items had accidentally fallen out of a building, the person responsible could be charged with committing a negligent act and be sentenced to jail and/or a fine. Litterbugs could also be charged with committing a rash act, like in this case, he added, when their act is seen as reckless and without care for consequences. "

The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Singapore Customs said in a joint release on Wednesday (Aug 21) that Veerappan Vimalraj, 33, had stored and dealt with 14,130 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes, evading $120,670 in duty and $8,900 in goods and services tax (GST). He also possessed 12,180 sachets of Khaini tobacco, a type of prohibited chewing tobacco, worth more than $24,000, which he intended to sell. The Singapore customs officers conducted an operation on May 21 and found Veerappan entering a storage facility in Neythal Road. A total of 10,680 sachets of the chewing tobacco and 13,130 packets of contraband cigarettes were found in the facility. Investigations found that Veerappan was paid $600 a month to sell both items. Another 1,500 sachets of chewing tobacco and 1,000 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes were also found in a car parked near the storage facility. Veerappan used the car to deliver the items to his customers. To avoid attention, he hid the items in a bush after reaching the delivery locations. After collecting the items, his customers would either place the payment in the same spot or hand him cash. The car and $5,927 in cash were also seized. Veerappan was found guilty and sentenced to jail for 19 months and 11 weeks. The seized cash was also forfeited. HSA and Customs reminded the public that importing, distributing, possessing for sale, selling or offering to sell emerging tobacco products are prohibited. These include shisha tobacco, smokeless tobacco, chewing tobacco such as Gutkha, Khaini, Zarda, vaporisers and their constituents. The public should also not purchase or bring any such harmful tobacco products into Singapore. Possessing, buying and using emerging tobacco products is also not allowed here and those found guilty can be fined up to $2,000 for each offence.

Mr Toh's lawyer accused Ms Angelina Jiang of telling untruths, saying it was unbelievable that a man in his 50s would make all those vows after less than a month of intimacy. She replied that when Mr Toh proposed, he told her he had stomach cancer and was living each day as though it was his last. ""He wanted a happy life with me, I was the woman in his heart,"" she said. Ms Jiang was taking the stand on the third day of the hearing into Mr Toh's High Court suit to get back $2 million he had paid her between December 2016 and March 2017. Mr Toh, who was indeed ill when they met, says the money was a loan that had to be repaid, while Ms Jiang says it was a gift. Ms Jiang said Mr Toh pursued her after they met in November 2016 when he responded to a newspaper advertisement she had placed to sell a Thomson shophouse that she owned. They began a relationship the following month, despite her initial reluctance to get involved with a married man, she said. On Dec 19, 2016, Mr Toh signed an agreement to lend her $200,000 to buy a Balestier shophouse. Ms Jiang said they had sex for the first time that day, after which Mr Toh tore up his copy of the agreement and waived the loan. She said that on Jan 12, 2017, Mr Toh made several vows at the temple, promising to buy a house for her, set up home with her and support her financially. Mr Toh's lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, attacked Ms Jiang's character in cross-examination and portrayed her as someone fixated with money, earning several objections from her lawyer, Mr Mahesh Rai. Justice Andrew Ang shut down a few lines of questioning, saying he would give Mr Lee some latitude to establish Ms Jiang's credibility, or lack thereof, but urged him to keep to the relevant issues. The judge noted that Ms Jiang's motives were not relevant to the case; what was relevant was whether Mr Toh had parted with his money by way of a gift or a loan. Mr Lee had asked China-born Ms Jiang, who became a Singapore citizen in 2014, to produce her identity card, asking why she had changed her name from Angelina to Victoria and back to Angelina. She said she changed her name to Victoria to get a new start as she was involved in ""many things"" but changed it back on July 30 this year because of the lawsuit. Mr Lee also grilled Ms Jiang, a graduate of Southwest University of Political Science and Law in her native Chongqing, on her sources of income. In 2016, she was a manager at a construction company earning $8,000 a month while selling property part-time. She said she also had income from introducing friends to come to Singapore for studies and to buy property and insurance. Mr Lee said the sums did not add up to her declared income for that year of more than $700,000. He suggested that she had falsely stated her income and boosted the figures so that she could obtain bank loans to buy property. She disagreed. Mr Lee also told the court that in December 2016, she owed $675,000 to seven banks in unsecured loans. Mr Toh's wife, Ms Chong Lee Yee, also took the stand on Wednesday to testify for him. She said she found out in March 2017 that he had paid sums of money to Ms Jiang and asked him to demand repayment. ""I told my husband this woman is out to cheat you,"" she said. She produced numerous photos she said she had secretly taken off her husband's phone of chat messages between Mr Toh and Ms Jiang. She said the photos included nude pictures Ms Jiang had taken to ""seduce"" her husband, but the judge said it would not be necessary to show them to the court. "

Yeo Wee Soon, who pleaded guilty to the charge, bought the poodle named To-Bi online about a week before the abuse occurred. On Feb 6 last year, Yeo, 41, was washing To-Bi, whose fur was smeared with faeces. The dog struggled and Yeo ""tapped"" it twice to discipline it, said NParks prosecutor Packer Mohammad. When the dog responded by biting Yeo's finger, the man ""tapped"" the dog harder the third time and it collapsed. Yeo tried to revive the dog by hitting its head against the bathtub twice. He then put To-Bi in ice water and showered it in cold water, added Mr Packer. The dog then became motionless. Yeo put To-Bi in a pail and dropped it into the river along Delta Avenue, the court heard. ""The action was unreasonable and led to the unnecessary death of the dog,"" Mr Packer added. Action was taken against Yeo after his parents heard To-Bi wailing and saw their son taking a pail out of the house and returning without it. When they could not find To-Bi, they suspected something was amiss and called the police. Causing a dog unnecessary pain or suffering can bring fines of up to $15,000 or jail up to 18 months, or both. "

Deputy Public Prosecutor Ang Siok Chen said the video later went viral and was shared on Facebook as well as on citizen journalism site Stomp. The 24-year-old Indonesian maid was yesterday sentenced to eight months' jail after pleading guilty to one count of ill-treating the boy. She cannot be named as a gag order has been imposed to protect the boy's identity. DPP Ang told District Judge Ng Peng Hong that the maid started working for the boy's family in November last year.

The victim continued to struggle and the accused got frustrated. ""She then deliberately threw the victim onto the ground and carried (him) up again.

But two days later, she came across the video on Facebook and learnt the truth. She made a police report and took her son to hospital, where he was found with mild tenderness over his spine.

Choo left the scene after the incident, which took place at around 7pm on June 13, 2017, and returned home to Rivervale Crescent in Sengkang. The police caught him three days later in an ambush. Choo, 28, was sentenced yesterday to a week's jail for injuring Mr Wan by riding his device in a rash manner. On the day of the incident, Mr Wan was working outside Lobby D of Compass Heights condominium in Sengkang Square, and was tasked to ensure residents' safety. At around 7pm, he spotted Choo riding his e-scooter on a walkway outside the lobby. The younger man was travelling at about 11kmh.

But her lawyer pointed out in cross-examination yesterday that Mr Toh Eng Tiah continued to send sexually intimate messages to Ms Angelina Jiang, 33, even after he found out he had been misled. Mr Toh took the stand on the second day of the hearing of his High Court suit against Ms Jiang to recover the $2 million, which he says was a loan that had to be repaid. Ms Jiang, a property agent, says it was a gift he is not entitled to reclaim. The two met in November 2016, and between December 2016 and March 2017, Mr Toh paid her more than $1 million, of which at least $819,000 was used to pay her credit card bills and living expenses, said Ms Jiang. On March 24, 2017, they signed a loan agreement for $2 million, including the sum already advanced, and Mr Toh paid her another $872,000. He said he realised he had been duped on April 5, 2017, when his lawyer told him that some terms had been changed from what had been drafted. For instance, the repayment period had been extended to 10 years instead of five. Yesterday, Ms Jiang's lawyer, Mr Mahesh Rai, sought to poke holes in Mr Toh's claim of being cheated, citing examples of how he continued treating her normally after April 5. That very evening, the pair exchanged messages ""of a sexual nature"", Mr Rai noted. On April 10, Mr Toh addressed Ms Jiang as his wife and told her she was ""the person who is the most truthful to (him)"". In other messages, Mr Toh discussed investment opportunities with Ms Jiang and told her that the $2 million was a gift. Mr Rai asserted that the continued exchange of messages showed Mr Toh had not been cheated when he signed the amended document, but the businessman disagreed. Questioned by his own lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, Mr Toh said his feelings for Ms Jiang faded after he found out about the amended contract. But he continued to communicate with her because she had promised to return him the money earlier than stipulated, he said. Mr Rai also sought to establish that the loan agreement had been concocted by the pair to placate Mr Toh's wife, Ms Chong Lee Yee. After discovering the affair, Ms Chong had phoned Ms Jiang in January and told her to leave Mr Toh. Mr Rai contended that on March 20, 2017, Mr Toh phoned Ms Jiang and told her his wife was making things difficult and he needed the loan agreement to prove his mistress was not after his money. He also said his wife was unhappy because he was willing to give her only $3 million and two properties after 10 years of marriage. Mr Toh disagreed. "

Anyone found guilty of not reporting the movement of cash of more than $20,000 can be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to three years, or both. The police reminded the public to declare if they are physically moving over $20,000 in cash - or its equivalent in foreign currency - into or out of Singapore, and that failure to do so is an offence.

Mr Toh was taking the stand on the second day of the hearing of his High Court suit against Ms Jiang to recover the $2 million, which he says was a loan that had to be repaid. Ms Jiang, a property agent, says it was a gift that he was not entitled to reclaim. The two met in November 2016, and between December 2016 and March 2017, Mr Toh paid her more than $1 million, of which at least $819,000 was used to pay her credit card bills and living expenses, said Ms Jiang. On March 24, 2017, they signed a loan agreement for $2 million, including the sum already advanced, and Mr Toh paid her another $872,000. He said he realised he had been duped on April 5, 2017, when his lawyer told him that some terms had been changed from what had been drafted. For instance, the repayment period had been extended to 10 years instead of five. On Tuesday, Ms Jiang's lawyer, Mr Mahesh Rai, sought to poke holes in Mr Toh's claim that he had been cheated, citing examples of how he continued treating her normally after April 5. That very evening, the pair exchanged messages ""of a sexual nature"", Mr Rai noted. On April 10, Mr Toh addressed Ms Jiang as his wife and told her she was ""the person who is the most truthful to me"". In other messages, Mr Toh discussed investment opportunities with Ms Jiang and told her that the $2 million was a gift. Mr Rai asserted that the continued exchange of messages shows Mr Toh had not been cheated when he signed the amended document, but the businessman disagreed. Questioned by his own lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, Mr Toh said his feelings for Ms Jiang faded after he found out about the amended contract. But he continued to communicate with her because she had promised to return him the money earlier than stipulated, he said. Mr Rai also sought to establish that the loan agreement had been concocted by the pair to placate Mr Toh's wife, Ms Chong Lee Yee. After discovering the affair, Ms Chong had phoned Ms Jiang in January and told her to leave Mr Toh, saying he was ""not a good man"" and had many girlfriends. Mr Rai contended that on March 20, Mr Toh phoned Ms Jiang and told her that his wife was making things difficult and he needed the loan agreement to show his wife that his mistress was not after his money. Mr Toh also told Ms Jiang his wife was unhappy and jealous because he was only willing to give the latter $3 million and two properties despite their 10-year marriage. Mr Toh disagreed. The trial continues. "

Choo left the scene after the incident, which took place around 7pm on June 13, 2017, and returned home to Rivervale Crescent in Sengkang. The police caught him three days later in an ambush. Choo, 28, was sentenced on Tuesday (Aug 20) to a week's jail for injuring Mr Wan by riding his device in a rash manner. On the fateful day, Mr Wan was working outside Lobby D of Compass Heights condominium in Sengkang Square and was tasked to ensure residents' safety. Around 7pm, he spotted Choo riding his e-scooter on a walkway outside the lobby's exit. The younger man was travelling at about 11kmh. Deputy Public Prosecutor Dwayne Lum told a district court Mr Wan signalled to Choo to move to a nearby public pavement and to coax him there, he stood in the middle of the walkway. As Choo was unable to adjust the direction of his e-scooter in time, Mr Wan's left shoulder brushed his body, causing Choo to lose slight control of his device. Choo got angry, made a U-turn on his scooter and sped towards Mr Wan. His device hit the security officer who fell backwards. Choo then returned home, said DPP Lum. An eyewitness made a report at the Sengkang Neighbourhood Police Centre. Mr Wan was taken to hospital in an ambulance and a June 22, 2017, medical report said he injured his scalp.

He allegedly returned to the same toilet later that year, where he raped a 14-year-old in October and violated a girl of the same age in November.

Their young victims cannot be named due to their age. In an unrelated case, District Judge Mathew Joseph sentenced a third rider, Toh Zhiwei, 35, to one week's jail for committing a similar offence. He was convicted on July 24 after a trial. Lutfi, who was sentenced to nine months' probation, was riding his e-scooter near a bus stop in Simei Street 6 when he hit a three-year-old girl in 2017. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng told District Judge May Mesenas: ""The accused failed to slow down despite noticing that there was a crowd of pedestrians and commuters present waiting for the bus. The accused... proceeded to ride his e-scooter at a speed of about 17kmh (to) 19kmh... which was unsafe in the circumstances."" He tried to stop his e-scooter but it hit the girl, who fell. She was taken to Changi General Hospital with a knee wound and a minor head injury. Yap was given six months' probation after he knocked into a nine-year-old boy who was getting off a bus.

But property agent Angelina Jiang, 33, has produced chat messages to argue that the money was a gift to her that Mr Toh Eng Tiah was not entitled to reclaim. Mr Toh, who also goes by the name Andy, said in one message: ""Give birth to a daughter will have a reward of 2 million."" In other messages, he told her ""don't need to pay the money back to me"" and ""I have given you $2 million as a gift"". Citing these messages as the case opened in the High Court yesterday, Ms Jiang's lawyer Mahesh Rai said Mr Toh was acting ""dishonourably"" by going back on his word and trying to claw back the money. ""The evidence will show that the parties were in a romantic relationship and that the monies had been given to Ms Jiang unconditionally as gifts,"" he said in his opening statement. Mr Toh's lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, responded by calling Ms Jiang a ""money grabber"". Mr Lee argued that his client never intended to gift Ms Jiang with $2 million and that the series of payments from Mr Toh to her between December 2016 and March 2017 was a loan that had to be repaid. Mr Toh runs three companies that collect and sell recycled materials. He has two children from his first marriage and one out of wedlock, but none from his current marriage. Ms Jiang is a property agent who made as much as $700,000 a year and owns two properties, the court heard. The Chinese national became a Singapore citizen in 2014 and has two children from a previous marriage. The two met in November 2016, when Mr Toh contacted Ms Jiang after seeing a newspaper advertisement for a property sale. They soon began a relationship, with Mr Toh showering Ms Jiang with expensive gifts and even giving her the personal identification number to his debit card, said Mr Rai. At a temple in January 2017, Mr Toh vowed, among other things, to pay her living expenses and credit card bills, set up a home with her and take care of their children, he said. Mr Toh told Ms Jiang that he was unhappy in his marriage and asked for her help to look for a divorce lawyer, said Mr Rai. On March 24, 2017, both parties signed a loan agreement, prepared by their respective lawyers. Prior to the signing of the document, Mr Toh paid more than $1 million to Ms Jiang, although the exact amount is disputed. After the agreement was signed, he paid her another $872,000. <strong>On March 24, 2017, both parties signed a loan agreement, prepared by their respective lawyers... Ms Jiang claims that the agreement was a sham document for Mr Toh to show his wife that he had only lent his lover the money and would eventually be repaid... Mr Toh argues that the document was evidence to support his version that the $2 million was a loan.</strong> On April 19, 2017, Ms Jiang discovered that she was pregnant and a month later, Mr Toh became uncontactable. On June 13, 2017, Ms Jiang received a letter from his lawyers, demanding that she repay the $2 million. More than two weeks later, she suffered a miscarriage. Mr Toh denies fathering her child and has refused to undergo a paternity test. Mr Rai told the court that Ms Jiang had a DNA profile done of the unborn child, which is waiting to be matched with the father's. Both sides now argue - for different reasons - that the loan agreement is not valid. Ms Jiang claims that the agreement was a sham document for Mr Toh to show his wife that he had only lent his lover the money and would eventually be repaid. Mr Toh contends that the agreement should be declared null and void as he had signed it under Ms Jiang's undue influence and the terms were unfair to him. However, Mr Toh argues that the document was evidence to support his version that the $2 million was a loan. The trial continues. "

Prosecutors had sought the sentence for 51-year-old Khoo, who was convicted last month of murdering engineer Cui Yajie, 31, on July 12, 2016. Justice Audrey Lim said the case did not warrant the death penalty, which is imposed in cases where the offender exhibits viciousness or blatant disregard for human life. Khoo admitted that he strangled Ms Cui in his BMW and later burned her body at Lim Chu Kang Lane 8 over several days, until nothing was left except clumps of hair, pieces of partly burnt fabric and a bra hook. Justice Lim said Khoo, who was being pressed by Ms Cui to repay a $20,000 debt, wanted to silence her to rid himself of the financial pressure and threat of ruin that she posed. But the judge said the evidence did not show that Khoo had planned to kill Ms Cui. He was unaware that she had suddenly intended to go to his office to confront his bosses that day, and his initial plan was to dissuade her from doing so, said the judge. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" delta=""1"" element=""1"" fid=""790674"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2019/08/19/st_20190719_semurder7vfe_49877162.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" width=""780""/><br/><figcaption>Ms Cui, a Chinese national, was a senior engineer at a semiconductor company. She and Khoo began a relationship in 2015. PHOTO: FACEBOOK</figcaption><br/></figure> Khoo had set up a conference call with his supervisor, intercepted Ms Cui at Joo Koon MRT station, and took her to a secluded place to calm her down, said the judge. Justice Lim said that while Khoo had pressed Ms Cui's neck with great force, there was no evidence of a ""sustained onslaught"". Even though Khoo did not call for help after she became motionless and went to great lengths to dispose of her body, this was not relevant for sentencing. Khoo, who is married with a son, was a retail outlet manager for a laundry firm, while Ms Cui, a Chinese national, was a senior engineer at a semiconductor company. They began a relationship in 2015 but Khoo lied to her, saying that the laundry company belonged to his family and that he was single. When she later became suspicious, he told her that he was divorced. He also persuaded her to invest $20,000 in gold. She borrowed the amount from her parents. When she chased him for the money, Khoo asked a former lover to remit $10,000 to Ms Cui's father. Meanwhile, Khoo's wife confronted him for cheating on her, after Ms Cui sent her a Facebook message to stay away from him. In the early hours of July 12, 2016, he picked Ms Cui up from Joo Koon MRT station in his car, purportedly to meet his supervisor. Instead, he drove her to a secluded location near Gardens by the Bay, and strangled her. According to Khoo, after she stopped moving, he covered her body with laundry bags and parked the car overnight at his condominium. Khoo denied he was in a romantic relationship with Ms Cui, although he admitted he had affairs with other women.

But property agent Angelina Jiang, 33, has produced chat messages to argue that the money was a gift to her that Mr Toh Eng Tiah was not entitled to reclaim. Mr Toh, who also goes by the name Andy, said in one message: ""Give birth to a daughter will have a reward of 2 million."" In other messages, he told her ""don't need to pay the money back to me"" and ""I have given you $2 million as a gift"". Citing these messages as the case opened in the High Court on Monday (Aug 19), Ms Jiang's lawyer, Mr Mahesh Rai, said Mr Toh was acting ""dishonorably"" by going back on his word and trying to claw back the money. ""The evidence will show that the parties were in a romantic relationship and that the monies had been given to Ms Jiang unconditionally as gifts,"" he said in his opening statement. Mr Toh's lawyer, Mr Anthony Lee, responded by calling Ms Jiang a ""money grabber"". Mr Lee argued that his client never intended to gift Ms Jiang $2 million and that the series of payments from Mr Toh to her made between December 2016 and March 2017 was a loan that had to be repaid. Mr Toh runs three companies that collect and sell recycled materials. He has two children from his first marriage and one out of wedlock, but none from his current marriage. Ms Jiang is a property agent who made as much as $700,000 a year and owns two properties, the court heard. The Chinese national became a Singapore citizen in 2014 and has two children from a previous marriage. The two met in November 2016, when Mr Toh contacted Ms Jiang after seeing a newspaper advertisement for a property sale. They soon began a relationship, with Mr Toh showering Ms Jiang with expensive gifts and even giving her the personal identification number to his debit card, said Mr Rai. At a temple in January 2017, Mr Toh vowed, among other things, to pay her living expenses and credit card bills, set up a home with her and take care of their children, he added. Mr Toh had told Ms Jiang that he was unhappy in his marriage and asked for her help to look for a divorce lawyer, said Mr Rai. On March 24, 2017, both parties signed a loan agreement prepared by their respective lawyers. Prior to the signing of the document, Mr Toh had paid more than $1 million to Ms Jiang, although the exact amount is disputed. After the agreement was signed, he paid her another $872,000. On April 19, 2017, Ms Jiang discovered that she was pregnant and a month later, Mr Toh became uncontactable. On June 13, 2017, Ms Jiang received a letter from Mr Toh's lawyers, demanding that she repay the $2 million. More than two weeks later, she suffered a miscarriage. Mr Toh denies fathering her child and to date, has refused to undergo a paternity test. Mr Rai told the court that Ms Jiang had a DNA profile done of the unborn child, which is waiting to be matched with the father's. Both sides now argue - for different reasons - that the loan agreement is not valid. Ms Jiang claims that the agreement was a sham document that Mr Toh could show his wife that he had only lent his lover the money and would eventually be repaid. Mr Toh contends that the agreement should be declared null and void as he had signed it under Ms Jiang's undue influence and the terms were unfair to him. However, Mr Toh argues that the document was evidence to support his version that the $2 million was a loan. The trial continues. "

ICA officers found the cigarettes while conducting checks on the arriving Malaysia-registered lorry on July 27 at about 9am. The lorry was carrying a consignment of 16 concrete blocks. The officers spotted anomalies in the concrete blocks so they drilled holes and uncovered the cigarettes hidden within. The 25-year-old male Malaysian driver was immediately arrested and the case was handed over to the Singapore Customs for further investigation. This is the largest haul of duty-unpaid cigarettes uncovered by ICA in the last five years. The total duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) evaded amounted to $1,240,430 and $90,590 respectively.

Alvin Ker Jia Jun, 31, pleaded guilty on Monday (Aug 19) to 40 cheating charges involving 23 people and about $300,000. Another 94 cheating charges linked to the remaining amount, as well as one count of dealing with the proceeds of his criminal activities, will be taken into consideration during sentencing. He committed his offences from 2017 to last year. Each cheating charge involved between $200 and $40,000. Some of his victims, which included his friends, were cheated multiple times. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kelvin Chong told District Judge Edgar Foo that Ker developed a gambling habit in 2017. Ker then hatched a plan to convince others to hand him cash so that he would have more money to gamble. He then used his personal Facebook account to create various posts for non-existent investment schemes which purported to offer attractive guaranteed rates of return. The DPP said that one of these was a scheme that offered to double the money that investors put into it within a year, while guaranteeing the capital that had been invested. After creating the posts, Ker asked his friends to help share these on their own social media platforms to gain more visibility and publicity. The court heard that many unsuspecting victims then approached Ker on Facebook or called his mobile phone, as they were interested in investing. Ker would then offer them a ""litany"" of explanations on how their money would be ""invested"". For instance, he told some of them that their cash would be used for investments in an educational institution. Ker also claimed that his victims' cash would be invested in an opportunity related to the SkillsFuture scheme provided by the Government. Instead, he used their money to gamble in casinos both in Singapore and overseas. The court heard that Ker transferred a portion of his winnings into some of the victims' bank accounts to cover his tracks. DPP Chong said: ""After transferring the amount, the accused would (take a) screenshot of the bank transfer screen in his mobile banking application and post the screenshot on his Facebook page. This was done so as to create confidence in the purported investment scheme and to motivate more people to invest money with him."" However, Ker later went on a losing streak. To placate his victims, who were asking for their returns, he would come up with excuses such as claiming that he had reached his transfer limit. He eventually lost all the money his victims had given him, the court heard. The police were alerted and he was arrested on March 5 last year when he returned to Singapore from a gambling trip in Vietnam. He has since paid more than $100,000 in restitution. Ker, who is represented by lawyer Steven John Lam, is expected to be sentenced on Oct 15. For each count of cheating, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

Lin Rongxin, who appeared in court on Monday (August 19) via video link, is facing seven counts of rape and one of sexual assault by penetration. The 31-year-old is currently in remand for psychiatric assessment. One of the earliest offences occurred sometime between September and December last year, when Lin allegedly raped an 18-year-old girl in a cubicle of a men's toilet on the seventh storey of Block 1008 Toa Payoh North, an industrial building. He allegedly returned to the same toilet on two separate occasions later that year, where he raped a 14-year-old in October and in the following month, violated another girl of the same age by performing oral sex on her. Then, in March and subsequently sometime between May and June the following year, Lin committed rape on two more girls in the same toilet, the court documents state. The girls were 17 and 14 years old respectively. He is also accused of committing rape on three other occasions, at three locations in central Singapore. Last December, he allegedly raped a 14-year-old girl at a unit at executive condominium Bishan Loft. Three months later, in February, he allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl at an undisclosed location in Toa Payoh. Then, in May, he allegedly raped a 19-year-old girl in a room at Balestier Hotel in Balestier Road. If convicted, Lin could be jailed up to 20 years and liable for a fine or caning if convicted for rape or sexual assault by penetration. When The Straits Times visited the industrial building at Block 1008 Toa Payoh North on Monday, tenants of more than 10 units across different floors said they did not recognise the accused's name. An employee who worked at an office on the seventh floor said she saw police leading a male suspect to the men's toilet on the same floor last month, but did not recognise who the man was. The employee, who declined to be named, said the police told her colleagues and her that they were investigating a case, and the toilet remained locked for ""quite a while"". It is not the first time an alleged crime has taken place at the toilet, she noted, as her colleague had stopped a man who had entered the women's toilet on the same floor last year. They believed him to be a Peeping Tom, and called the cops on him, she said. ""The atmosphere is quite scary at night. It is very very quiet,"" she said. Other tenants of the building said security is lax in the building. There were no closed circuit TV cameras in sight, and no security guards present when The Straits Times visited the site on Monday evening. A tenant on the sixth floor, who gave his name as Mr Vejay, said anybody can enter the building which has multiple entrance and exit points with little surveillance. ""When we come here on weekends, it is really a dead (town). There is no security and anybody can enter. Everything you do here is at your own risk,"" said Mr Vejay, 45, the owner of a sports nutrition company. Efforts have been made to lock all the toilets, with the building's management issuing keys to tenants and leaving signs on the doors reminding them to keep the toilets locked after use. But tenants said the male toilets are largely left unlocked out of convenience. "

Student Muhammad Lutfi Dzakir Abdul Rahman, 18, and full-time national serviceman Yap Thanabadee, 19, had pleaded guilty to causing injuries to children while riding their devices in a rash manner in two separate incidents. The young victims cannot be named because of their age. In an unrelated case, District Judge Mathew Joseph sentenced a third rider, Toh Zhiwei, 35, to one week's jail on Monday for committing a similar offence. He was convicted on July 24 after a trial. Lutfi, who was sentenced to nine months' probation, was riding his e-scooter near a bus stop in Simei Street 6 on Aug 10, 2017, when he hit a three-year-old girl. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng told District Judge May Mesenas: ""The accused failed to slow down despite noticing that there was a crowd of pedestrians and commuters present waiting for the bus. ""The accused... proceeded to ride his e-scooter at a speed of about 17 (to) 19kmh... a speed which was unsafe in the circumstances."" He tried to stop his e-scooter but it hit the girl, who fell to the ground. She was taken to Changi General Hospital with a cut knee and a minor head injury. The other teen, Yap, was given six months' probation after he knocked into a nine-year-old boy who was getting off a bus with his father. The youngster suffered wounds to his ear and knee. The court heard that Yap had been riding at about 25kmh when he hit the boy at a bus stop in front of Block 210 Jurong East Street 21 in the afternoon of March 24. In the unrelated case, Toh was riding his e-scooter near Chinatown MRT station on Jan 26 last year when he ran into a Taiwanese tourist's right heel. Madam Liang Yuan-Chia, 45, fell and hit her head on the ground. Toh claimed he was travelling between 13kmh and 15kmh. The court heard that he had stopped to help Madam Liang and also called for an ambulance. She was taken to the Singapore General Hospital and was found to have a minor head injury as well as strained muscle in her buttocks. Toh was arrested later that day. He intends to appeal against District Judge Mathew Joseph's decision and his bail was set at $15,000. For causing hurt by performing a rash act, offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. "

Prosecutors had sought a life sentence for 51-year-old Khoo, who was convicted last month of murdering engineer Cui Yajie, 31, on July 12, 2016. Justice Audrey Lim said the case did not warrant the death penalty, which is imposed in cases where the offender exhibits viciousness or blatant disregard for human life. Khoo admitted that he strangled Ms Cui in his BMW and later burned her body in Lim Chu Kang Lane 8 over several days, until nothing was left except clumps of hair, pieces of partly burnt fabric and a bra hook. Justice Lim said Khoo, who was being pressed by Ms Cui to repay a $20,000 debt, wanted to silence her to get rid of the financial pressure and threat of ruin that she posed. But the judge said the evidence did not show that Khoo had planned to kill Ms Cui. He was unaware that Ms Cui had suddenly intended to go to his office to confront his bosses that day, and his initial plan was to dissuade her from doing so, said the judge. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" delta=""1"" element=""1"" fid=""790674"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2019/08/19/st_20190719_semurder7vfe_49877162.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" width=""780""/><br/><figcaption>Ms Cui, a Chinese national, was a senior engineer at a semiconductor company. She and Khoo began a relationship in 2015.

Even though Khoo did not call for help after she became motionless and went to great lengths to dispose of her body, this was not relevant for sentencing. Khoo, who is married with a son, was a retail outlet manager for a laundry firm, while Ms Cui, a Chinese national, was a senior engineer at a semiconductor company. They began a relationship in 2015 but Khoo lied to her, saying that the laundry company belonged to his family and that he was single. When she later became suspicious, he told her he was divorced. He also persuaded her to invest $20,000 in gold, which she borrowed from her parents to give him. When she chased him for the money, Khoo asked a former lover to remit $10,000 to Ms Cui's father. Meanwhile, Khoo's wife confronted him for cheating on her, after Ms Cui sent her a Facebook message to stay away from him. In the early hours of July 12, 2016, he picked up Ms Cui from Joo Koon MRT station in his car, purportedly to meet his supervisor. Instead, he drove her to a secluded location near Gardens by the Bay and strangled her. According to Khoo, after she stopped moving, he covered her body with laundry bags and parked the car overnight at his condominium. Khoo denied he was in a romantic relationship with Ms Cui, although he admitted he had affairs with other women. It is the second case in Singapore's legal history in which a person has been convicted of murder in the absence of a body. The first was that of one-time Grand Prix driver Sunny Ang, who was sentenced to hang in 1965 for killing his barmaid girlfriend at sea after taking out insurance policies on her life. "

Reducing the jail term from 23 years and 11 months to 19 years and 11 months, the court agreed with his lawyers that the original sentence was ""crushing"" for someone who was relatively young and had a clean record until the offences. The man, who cannot be named to protect the woman's identity, pleaded guilty last year to two charges of abetment of rape and one charge of abetment of sexual assault by penetration. He was sentenced to 23 years and 11 months' jail and 24 strokes of the cane. At his appeal on Thursday, the man, represented by Mr Ramesh Tiwary and Ms Diana Ngiam, argued that the sentence was significantly above that for rape offences. Mr Tiwary said the trial judge had not calibrated the individual sentences for each charge to ensure that the combined sentence was not manifestly excessive. He said the man had offered to testify against the co-accused and pleaded guilty to spare the victim the trauma of testifying in court. Deputy Public Prosecutor Winston Man said the man was not as cooperative as portrayed, noting he pleaded guilty only last November but the offences took place in 2016. The court, comprising Judge of Appeal Judith Prakash and Justices Chao Hick Tin and Woo Bih Li, cited the totality principle in reducing the jail and caning sentences for each charge, making a final sentence of 19 years and 11 months. The man had cajoled his girlfriend to engage in bondage sex but she refused when he suggested that a third person join them for sex. He then hatched a plan for a threesome - without her knowledge - with 23-year-old Srihari Mahendran, whom he had met online. On April 29, 2016, he tied her hands, blindfolded her and let Srihari into the hotel room. He had sex with her before Srihari took over. In August 2016, the woman arranged a staycation to celebrate the man's birthday and he had Srihari join them. The woman realised something was amiss when she felt two people touching her. She removed her blindfold and saw Srihari. Both men were arrested at the hotel. Srihari's trial is expected to take place in November. "

Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department and seven police land divisions conducted the raids and arrested 83 men and 40 women, aged between 19 and 64. The police said 90 of the arrested suspects are believed to have opened bank accounts and given away their ATM cards and personal identification numbers to loan sharks to facilitate their unlicensed moneylending businesses. About 23 suspects are believed to be runners, who carry out ATM transfers on behalf of loan sharks while eight of the suspects were arrested for alleged acts of loan shark harassment, which include splashing paint and scrawling loan shark-related graffiti on walls. Two of the suspects are believed to have provided false contact information to get loans.

Activities for loan sharks include opening a bank account, distributing pamphlets, acting as a look-out, being a runner or acting as a harasser. Under the Moneylenders' Act, when a person's bank account or ATM card is used to facilitate unlicensed moneylending, that person is presumed to have assisted in the carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending.

Low Kin Leong, 29, who worked as an assistant operations manager at Lovis Diamonds, pleaded guilty on Friday (Aug 16) to one count each of criminal breach of trust and moving his criminal proceeds out of Singapore. The Malaysian was sentenced to three years' jail. He first joined Lovis Diamonds as a sales executive in 2013 before rising through the ranks to become an assistant operations manager. Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting said Low had been tasked with overseeing the sales operations at the company's two outlets. One was located at the Bedok Mall in New Upper Changi Road, while the other was at the Westgate shopping mall in Gateway Drive near Boon Lay Way. Low also had full authorisation to transfer items between the two outlets and the firm's headquarters in Kaki Bukit. He later decided that his last day at work would be Feb 24, 2016, and hatched a plan to misappropriate valuables from the shops. He asked one of his subordinates at the Bedok Mall outlet to take out 101 pieces of jewellery. After that, he used the store's point of sale system to indicate that the jewellery would be transferred to the company's Westgate outlet. At around 8pm, another subordinate saw Low arriving at the Westgate outlet with a bag of jewellery. DPP Ting told District Judge Edgar Foo: ""The accused used the (point of sale) system at the Westgate outlet to mark 298 pieces of jewellery - including the 101 pieces from the Bedok outlet - as being transferred to Lovis' headquarters."" Low then left the premises with the valuables in a black trash bag before the store closed for the day. At around 1.40pm the next day, he left Singapore with the misappropriated jewellery via Woodlands Checkpoint before selling the valuables in Malaysia. DPP Ting did not state the amount he received from selling them. She also told the court that the business manager at Lovis Diamonds alerted the police on Feb 28, 2016. The Singapore Police Force sought assistance from the Royal Malaysia Police, whose officers arrested Low on June 5 this year. He was brought back to Singapore two days later. The court heard that he has made no restitution. The jewellery and the proceeds from their sale were also not recovered. Low, who was unrepresented, pleaded for leniency and told Judge Foo that he had been supporting his family in Malaysia. For criminal breach of trust, he could have been jailed for up to 15 years and fined. "

The bento boxes were sent to the Kaki Bukit office of security company Brink's Singapore at 11.33am on Nov 6 last year, and an invoice from the eatery stated that the food had to be eaten within an hour of delivery.

In all, 26 people died in these accidents and 1,174 were injured last year, the Traffic Police said on Thursday (Aug 15). The corresponding figures in 2017 are 34 deaths and 1,143 injured. Last year's deaths occurred in 23 accidents. This is a 30 per cent drop from 33 in 2017 which, in turn, is lower than the 41 in 2016. On the other hand, heavy vehicle accidents that caused injuries rose 2.8 per cent last year, from 732 in 2017 to 753 in 2018. In 2016, there were 838 such accidents. Adding up the two categories of accidents, the total number of such accidents last year climbed to 776, which is 11 more than the 765 in 2017. To bring down the figures, an islandwide operation against errant heavy vehicles was carried out on Thursday by more than 20 officers from the Traffic Police, Land Transport Authority and the National Environment Agency. The operation was observed by the media, including The Straits Times. Riding on their black ""stealth bikes"", the covert Traffic Police officers from the Special Operations Team issued 26 summonses to 25 drivers for such offences as speeding and failing to keep to the left on expressways. In addition, 39 LTA offences, such as improper number plates, tinted windows and overloading, were detected by enforcement officers. In one case, the driver of a company van chalked up six offences for illegal modifications of the vehicle's front lights, headlights, rear lamps and number plate. Its heavily tinted driver's windows allowed only 4 per cent of light through. The van also had sunshades on the top and bottom of the front windscreen. LTA rules forbid sunshades to be installed more than 150mm from the top edge of the front windscreen. Sunshades on the bottom of the front windscreen are barred. Meanwhile, the NEA officers issued one summons to a driver for vehicular smoke emission. Such operations are carried out regularly as heavy vehicles are likely to cause damage and loss of lives in an accident, said Assistant Superintendent Lim Tiong Lam Anthony, the officer-in-charge of the Special Operations Team. At the same time, the Traffic Police will continue to engage heavy vehicle drivers and their companies to adopt good practices for safer driving, ASP Lim added. "

The man, who cannot be named to protect the woman's identity, had pleaded guilty to two charges of abetment of rape and one charge of abetment of sexual assault by penetration last year. The High Court sentenced him in November last year to a total of 24 years' jail and lopped one month off to take into account the time he had spent in custody. He was also sentenced to 24 strokes of the cane. At his appeal on Thursday, the man, represented by Mr Ramesh Tiwary and Ms Diana Ngiam, argued that the sentence was significantly above that for rape offences . Mr Tiwary said that the trial judge had not calibrated the individual sentences for each charge to ensure that the combined sentence was not manifestly excessive. He added that the man had offered to testify against the co-accused and pleaded guilty to save the victim from the trauma of testifying in court. Deputy Public Prosecutor Winston Man argued that the man was not as cooperative as portrayed, noting that he pleaded guilty only last November but the offences came to light in 2016. The court, comprising Judge of Appeal Judith Prakash and Justices Chao Hick Tin and Woo Bih Li, cited the totality principle in reducing the jail and caning sentences for each individual charge, making a final sentence of 19 years and 11 months. The principle requires a judge meting out sentences for multiple offences to ensure that the aggregate sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality. There was no practical change to the caning sentence as the maximum number a person can receive is 24. The man had cajoled his girlfriend into engaging in bondage sex but she refused when he suggested inviting a third person to join them for sex. He then came up with a plan for a threesome - without her knowledge - with 23-year-old Srihari Mahendran, whom he had met online. On April 29, 2016, after tying her hands and blindfolding her, the man let Srihari into the hotel room. He had sex with the woman before Srihari took over. In August 2016, when the woman arranged a staycation at a hotel to celebrate the man's birthday, he made plans for Srihari to join them. She realised that something was amiss when she felt two people touching her at the same time and when she removed her blindfold, she saw Srihari in the room. He then left the hotel. The man begged her not to alert the police, but she demanded that he call Srihari back to the hotel. He and Srihari were later arrested at the hotel. Srihari's trial is expected to take place in November. "

In an advisory on Thursday (Aug 15), the police said there have been at least 71 reports made about such scams from January to May. In the cases, victims were unknowingly saddled with loans while they were trying to buy mobile phones online. Some of the victims were deceived into providing personal information such as their NRIC, SingPass or bank account details, thinking that they were signing up for an instalment plan to buy the mobile phones. They later discovered a sum of money deposited into their bank accounts and the scammers then demanded that they repay the loan amount with interest. In other instances, the victims were offered loans to buy the mobile phones. They would then receive a sum of money in their bank accounts, regardless of whether they had agreed to the loan offers or not. They were then asked to make repayments. The police advise members of the public to take the following precautions against such scams: - Never give your personal information such as NRIC, SingPass or bank account details to strangers or unverified sources. Do not provide information that is not necessary to make a purchase. - If you suspect that you have received an unknown sum of money in your bank account, report it to the bank and the police immediately. If the money is still in your account, do not make any transactions with it. - Check the track record and background of the company or seller before making a purchase. Be wary that fraud artists can appear and disappear on e-commerce platforms, so the lack of a complaint record is no guarantee of legitimacy. Those who wish to provide information related to such scams can call the police hotline 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at  They can also call the National Crime Prevention Council's ""X Ah Long"" hotline 1800-924-5664 to give information on unlicensed moneylenders.

Preventive detention is only for repeat offenders who are aged over 30, and it can see them incarcerated for up to 20 years. It will be the cleaner's third spell behind bars.

Rozaimie was sentenced to his second spell of CT in 2010 for robbery offences - this time, lasting for eight years with the maximum 24 strokes. He was released in April last year. Just five months later, he went to Orchard Towers and approached a 33-year-old Vietnamese sex worker. She agreed to have sex with him for $100, and they checked into a room at the New Orchid Hotel in Balestier Road. The pair started quarrelling after Rozaimie said he wanted to pay her only after they had sex. When she tried to leave, he grabbed her hand and blocked the door. She tried to push him away and he retaliated by punching her in the head several times. He also scratched her face, neck and chest.

Ng Yong Jing, 28, also known as Sean, admitted to 19 cheating charges involving $4,500 and one count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice. Another 187 charges linked to the remaining amount will be considered during sentencing. He committed the offences against WDA, now known as SkillsFuture Singapore, in 2016. Fellow mastermind Tay Sheng Yang, 28 , who was one of Ng's accomplices, was sentenced last month to two years' jail after pleading guilty to 19 cheating charges and one count of obstructing the course of justice. The cases involving two other alleged masterminds - Joshua Tan Jun Liang, 28, and Lim Biao, 27 - are pending. The court heard that the cheating charges involved the SkillsFuture Credits (SFC) scheme, launched in 2016 to encourage individuals to take ownership of their skill development and lifelong learning. It gives Singaporeans aged 25 and older an opening credit of $500 in their SFC account which can be used to pay for approved courses. Tay was one of the directors of two companies, A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Between February and March 2016, WDA approved four courses to be funded by the SFC under the two firms. They were in areas such as professional selling and financial modelling. Ng was the only trainer for both firms, Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Goh told District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan. The DPP said that in early 2016, Tay and Ng discussed an idea to increase the sales of courses offered by the companies by paying fees to people who referred trainees to register for the courses. She also said Lim later became involved in the plan and the trio talked about giving cash directly to trainees as part of an effort to increase sales. Lim later told Tan about the plan, the court heard. A training provider under the SFC scheme is not supposed to pay trainees from disbursed SFC funds or even enter into such agreements, said DPP Goh. In April 2016, a firm known as C.G. Marketing (CGM) was set up with the sole purpose of promoting A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Lim and Tan managed CGM's operations. On June 1, 2016, the Commercial Affairs Department received a complaint from WDA against A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. On July 25 that year, Tay and Ng were arrested at the Tuas Checkpoint. Ng made restitution totalling $34,250 to SkillsFuture Singapore on May 31 this year. He is out on bail of $25,000 and is to be sentenced on Aug 26. "

Two Bangladeshi construction workers of Environmental Landscape, Mr Rahman Mohammad Ataur, 21, and Mr Miah Sobuj, 19, were deployed to clean an underground tank in Lorong Semangka near Old Choa Chu Kang Road on July 25 that year. The tank was 3.2m deep and was accessible by a ladder placed through the only open manhole at the time. The two workers entered the tank even though tests had not been done to assess whether there were any flammable or toxic gases in the vicinity. Mr Rahman then switched on a socket extension to activate a floodlight, sparking an explosion so powerful that it flung a third Bangla-deshi, Mr Uddin Mohammad Riaz, out of the entrance of the tank as he was climbing down the ladder. Mr Uddin, 27, an agritechnology worker, suffered burns, but his injuries were not as serious as the ones sustained by the other two Bangladeshis. Court documents did not reveal details about the pair's injuries but earlier media reports said Mr Rahman suffered third-degree burns on 73 per cent of his body. It was reported that he had to undergo skin grafts and needed reconstruction surgery for parts of his body, including his nose, lips and ears. Environmental Landscape was represented by lawyer Fazal Mohamed Abdul Karim, who told the court that Mr Rahman's medical treatment provided by the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) amounted to more than $434,000, while Mr Miah's bill was more than $432,000. The lawyer told District Judge Carol Ling that Mr Uddin's medical expenses were covered under the work injury compensation insurance. But the two younger men's medical expenses exceeded the coverage provided by their work injury compensation insurance. Mr Fazal said: ""After payments were made by the company, the balance SGH claimed amounted to $801,450.81... The company approached SGH to negotiate a settlement whereby the company would provide a total sum of $799,450.81, payable in (different) tranches."" The three Bangladeshis have since left Singapore. Environmental Landscape was convicted of an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act last month. Ministry of Manpower (MOM) prosecuting officer Lee Kui Bao said that at around 6.30pm on July 25, 2016, the trio and their colleague, Mr Alagappan Vignesh, 23, were instructed by their supervisor, Hossan Billal, 30, to clear residual water from the tank. The court heard that Mr Alagappan, an Indian national, did not enter the tank as it was his first day at work and he was supposed to familiarise himself with the job. In a statement yesterday, MOM said the trio and Mr Alagappan were not trained to work within a confined space. They were not informed of the risks involved, such as oxygen deficiency or the build-up of flammable gases that could lead to an explosion. The men were also not told of the safety precautions that should have been taken. The ministry said: ""The company also failed to develop and implement procedures for dealing with emergencies that might arise while its employees were at work in the confined space."" Hossan, who is also a Bangladeshi, has been charged with an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, and his case is still pending. For committing the offence under the Act, Environmental Landscape could have been fined up to $500,000. "

After cleaning her up, they put her on the bed, and Fadly took a ""wefie"" that he sent to a friend to brag. He then raped her and encouraged Hazly to do so as well. The other three later returned to the room. Faris had sex with the girl in the bathroom, but contended that she had propositioned him. After Faris left the bathroom, Asep went in, sexually violated her and tried to have sex with her, but did not succeed. Later that morning, Ridhwan had sex with her, but contended that it was consensual. After leaving the hotel, the victim tried to find out from her friends what had happened in the room.

The man, who was allowed to sleep in the same room as the two girls, started preying on the older girl when she was nine and carried on the abuse until she was 13. He also began abusing the younger girl when she turned nine. On separate occasions, he made them perform sex acts on him, either in the bedroom or in his car after they returned from outings. The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victims, pleaded guilty to three charges of aggravated sexual assault by penetration in January. Seven other charges were considered during sentencing. The jail term included one year in lieu of caning as he is above the age of 50. The High Court heard that the man, who lived in Malaysia and travelled to Singapore to work odd jobs, had known the victims' father for 20 years. The girls' father often asked him for financial help and to look after his family while he was remanded in prison. In 2011, the man, after divorcing his wife, began staying with the family on weekends and used their flat as his registered mailing address. He slept on a mattress between the two girls in their room, with the permission of their father. He joked with them and hugged them, bought them gifts, including a mobile phone for the older girl, and went on outings with them. The older girl even felt that he treated her better than her parents because he listened when she confided in him about her problems. That year, he began sexually assaulting the older girl. He touched her and asked her to perform oral sex on him, while the younger girl was asleep. In 2013, after a family outing, the man asked the younger girl to accompany him to park his car. After parking at the deserted top floor of a multi-storey carpark, he touched the girl and told her to perform oral sex on him. The man warned her not to tell anyone about what had happened. In 2015, the older girl tried to tell her parents about the sexual acts after the man made her perform oral sex on him. Court documents said her parents did not act on the information as they did not understand her. That year, she learnt in school that what the accused had done was wrong. However, she did not go to the police as she was worried about the consequences. The offences came to light in 2017, when the older girl was placed at the Pertapis Centre for Women and Girls after displaying suicidal tendencies. She told a child protection officer about the abuse and a police report was lodged. "

Two Bangladeshi construction workers of Environmental Landscape, Mr Rahman Mohammad Ataur, 21, and Mr Miah Sobuj, 19, were deployed to clean an underground tank in Lorong Semangka, near Old Choa Chu Kang Road, on July 25 that year. The tank was 3.2m deep and was accessible by a ladder placed through the only open manhole at the time. The two workers entered the tank even though tests had not been done to assess whether there were any flammable or toxic gases in the vicinity. Mr Rahman then switched on a socket extension to activate a floodlight, sparking an explosion so powerful that it flung a third Bangladeshi, Mr Uddin Mohammad Riaz, out of the entrance of the tank as he was climbing down the ladder.

The lawyer told District Judge Carol Ling that Mr Uddin's medical expenses were covered under work injury compensation insurance.

The court heard that Mr Alagappan, an Indian national, did not enter the tank as it was his first day at work and he was supposed to familiarise himself with the job. The explosion soon occurred after Mr Rahman switched on the socket extension, the court heard. Mr Lee said: ""The impact of the explosion threw Uddin out of the entrance of the confined space and propelled the ladder a distance away from it. Uddin then ran and dived into a nearby pond, about 10 to 15 metres away from the tank to douse the burning sensations on his body."" The other two Bangladeshis eventually managed to climb out of the tank using the ladder, which had been reinserted into the entrance and the men were taken to hospital. In a statement on Wednesday, MOM said the trio and Mr Alagappan were not trained to work within a confined space. They were also not informed of the risks involved, such as oxygen deficiency or the build-up of flammable gases that could lead to an explosion. The four men were also not informed of the safety precautions that should have been taken. The ministry said: ""The company also failed to develop and implement procedures for dealing with emergencies that might arise while its employees were at work in the confined space."" In the mitigation plea, Mr Fazal told the court that each injured worker received compensation for the injuries they sustained. The lawyer said his client compensated Mr Rahman a sum of $137,451.30. Mr Miah received $56,273.32, while Mr Uddin had been given $4,094.84, the court heard. Mr Fazal said: ""In the case of (Mr Rahman), whose injuries were the most serious, the company hired and paid for a caregiver to specially care for (his) daily needs after he was discharged from SGH on Dec 2, 2016. ""It is clear... that the company did not abandon the three workers. On the contrary, the company went above and beyond any obligation at law to ensure that they received the appropriate care to allow them to properly recover from their injuries."" Hossan, who is also a Bangladeshi, has been charged with an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, and his case is still pending. MOM's director of occupational safety and health inspectorate Sebastian Tan said in the statement that the company had endangered the lives of its workers by requiring them to perform a high-risk job without any training, instruction, safety equipment or emergency rescue system. He added: ""This blatant disregard for workplace safety and health is unacceptable. We will continue to press for high fines against employers who knowingly put their workers at risk."" For committing the offence under the Act, Environmental Landscape could have been fined up to $500,000. "

Preventive detention is only for repeat offenders who are aged more than 30, and can see them incarcerated for up to 20 years. It will be his third lengthy spell behind bars. In 2003, Rozaimie was sentenced to corrective training (CT) for offences, including criminal intimidation and drug consumption. He spent six years behind bars and was ordered to receive eight strokes of the cane. CT is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. But Rozaimie did not learn his lesson and was sentenced to his second spell of CT in 2010 for robbery offences - this time lasting for eight years with the maximum 24 strokes. He was released in April 2018. But just five months later, he went to Orchard Towers and approached a 33-year-old Vietnamese sex worker. She agreed to have sex with him for $100 and they checked into a room at the New Orchid Hotel in Balestier Road. The pair soon started quarrelling after Rozaimie said he wanted to pay her only after they had sex. When she tried to leave, he grabbed her hand and blocked the door. She tried to push him away and he retaliated by punching her in the head several times. He also scratched her face, neck and chest. The sex worker eventually managed to get away and alerted the police. In a separate incident on Dec 17 last year, the court heard that a Singaporean woman was walking towards Tanjong Pagar MRT station at around 11pm when she stopped to play a piano near the entrance of the URA Centre in Maxwell Road.

Rozaimie has made no restitution, the court heard. For robbery committed between 7pm and 7am, offenders can be jailed for between three and 14 years, and ordered to receive at least 12 strokes of the cane. "

She was in a state of ""oppression"" at the time and was therefore not fit to give a statement to the police that day, argued Mr Mohamed Muzammil Mohamed. Daryati, who turns 27 today, is on trial for stabbing and slashing Madam Seow Kim Choo on June 7, 2016, at her Telok Kurau home, leaving the 59-year-old woman with 98 knife wounds. In statements to the police, Daryati admitted that she slit Madam Seow's neck and stabbed her face and neck multiple times. The defence is arguing that seven of the nine statements, taken between June 8 and July 26, 2016, had not been given voluntarily and hence cannot be admitted as evidence. An ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of the statements began yesterday, starting with the first statement recorded while Daryati was in hospital. She had suffered injuries and was taken to Changi General Hospital on the same day as the killing. The next day, forensic pathologist Cuthbert Teo was asked by the police to examine the injuries that Daryati sustained on her hands. Photographs were also taken to document the injuries. Dr Teo testified that the maid consented to the examination and photography. He said he asked her if she had any other injuries on her body and sought her specific consent to undress her. A police photographer took about 40 photographs of her injuries, including two of abrasions around her left breast.

However, the court said the home owner's ""unreasonable"" actions, in denying access to the developer to fix the defects, reduce the quantum of damages that he can recover. Mr Thio Keng Thay, the former deputy managing director of Malaysia Dairy Industries, is seeking about $2 million from developer Sandy Island, which is part of the YTL Group. This includes costs he incurred in engaging third parties to investigate and rectify the defects, as well as damages for loss of use of the property between March 2012 and May 2015. The precise quantum of damages will be determined at a later hearing. In his lawsuit, Mr Thio, who is in his 70s, alleged that the house - which comprises three floors and a basement and has a private swimming pool - contained 492 defects. This, he said, constituted a breach of the developer's contractual obligation to build the property in a good and workmanlike manner. Mr Thio, who is represented by Senior Counsel Cavinder Bull and Mr Daniel Cai, alleged that the defects made it ""uninhabitable"". These include water seepage in a number of rooms and rain ingress on the first floor. He also alleged that the passenger lift and car lift on the property were unsafe. Sandy Island, represented by Senior Counsel Lok Vi Ming, admitted to more than 200 of the defects. But it contended that it was not liable to pay damages because Mr Thio had breached his contractual obligation to allow the developer to rectify the faults. The developer said it had been willing to rectify genuine defects, but was prevented from doing so by Mr Thio, who imposed ""unreasonable"" demands and refused to grant access to the property. Sandy Island countersued Mr Thio for defamation over his statements in an article published in The Straits Times in 2013, featuring his claims of defects. In a written judgment last month, Justice Lee Seiu Kin found that the defects and non-compliant lifts amounted to breaches of contract by Sandy Island. The judge also found that Mr Thio had breached his obligation to give the developer an opportunity to rectify the defects. ""From an early stage, the plaintiff did not act in a constructive manner in his dealings with the defendant,"" said the judge. Mr Thio initially told the developer that he would be sending over photos of the defects, but changed his mind. He then asked for a methodology for rectification works, before the developer had the chance to inspect the property. When the developer provided method statements, Mr Thio rejected them without explanation. However, the judge said Mr Thio still had the right to recover damages; his breach of contract affected only the quantum. As for the counterclaim, the judge found that Mr Thio, motivated by malice, had defamed the developer by suggesting that it was incapable of rectifying the defects. He awarded nominal damages of $1,000 as the developer has not suffered substantive damage to its reputation. "

District Judge Lee Li Choon, in dismissing damages sought by two residents for negligence, ruled that they failed to show that the MC of Pandan Valley condominium breached its duty of care. ""The plaintiffs have also not shown that the tree would not have fallen but for the negligence of the defendants in maintaining the tree,"" she said in decision grounds issued last month. The court, in the first such reported case on liability involving parked cars damaged by fallen trees on a condominium's common property, accepted that the MC had a duty of care. But the issue turned on whether the MC had breached the standard of care expected of it as the condominium's management agency and if such breaches led to the damage, said the district judge. The cars had been parked in the open carpark in front of Block 4 of Pandan Valley condominium on Dec 28, 2015, when it rained during the night. The next day, the two residents discovered that an angsana tree had fallen and damaged their cars. The duo claimed that the MC had failed to take adequate measures to ensure that the tree did not pose any reasonably foreseeable danger or did not fall and cause damage to property. Among other things, their respective lawyers, Mr Christopher Fernandez and Mr Faizal Mohamed Ashraf, alleged that the MC had failed to properly assess tree risk using arborists and to ensure adequate growing space for the tree. The MC countered that the tree showed no signs of decay or root rot and there was provision for pruning of the trees with a regular landscape contractor. The MC's lawyer, Mr Hong Heng Leong, further argued that it was exempt from liability as the vehicles were parked at the owners' risk, pointing to the conditions set out in the parking label issued to the car owners and on the notice placed at the carpark entrance. A single joint expert's report by certified arborist Thomas Richard Gordon listed three contributing factors that caused the tree to fall. The judge categorised them as environmental factors, force of gravity caused by the tree leaning, and restricted growing space that prevented the lateral spread of structural roots, which weakened the ""internal root structure"". The judge found that the MC could not be faulted for environmental factors or for the tree leaning as it could not be established that it was leaning before it fell. Neither was evidence shown that the MC fell short of industry standards for the pruning of trees in the condominium's common property. The incident was an unfortunate ""misadventure"", the judge said, taking a leaf out of the coroner's finding in the case of the tembusu tree that fell at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in February 2017 and caused the death of a 38-year-old woman. ""Even if the defendants were to be judged based on the standard of care that was practised by the Singapore Botanic Gardens at the time of the incident and had performed the relevant tree assessments on a regular basis, based on the same conclusion as drawn in the coroner's case, the internal root problem would still not have been detected,"" said the district judge. No evidence was shown that hiring a tree expert to do periodic tree risk assessment is the industry norm that the MC should have followed, she added. The judge ordered the duo to pay $7,000 each in costs plus reasonable disbursements to the MC. "

She claimed that he had driven her to a forested area in Punggol in a prime mover and raped her on two occasions and molested her once. She also accused him of sexually assaulting her in the family's flat on two occasions. The alleged offences were said to have taken place between 2009 and 2011, when she was between 15 and 16 years old, but came to light only towards the end of 2012. In clearing the man of the charges, the High Court judge had said the complainant's evidence was not unusually convincing because, among other things, there had been a delay in her disclosure of the offences. The judge also found that her account that the man frequently drove the prime mover was inconsistent with the testimony of his employer, who said he never saw the man drive the vehicle. She said she was assaulted on the rear bench behind the front driver and passenger's seats, but the man and his employer said dirty tools were placed there. The prosecution appealed against the acquittal. On Thursday, the three-judge Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and agreed that the girl's evidence was not unusually convincing, albeit on different grounds. In a judgment delivered by Judge of Appeal Judith Prakash, the court accepted that a victim of sexual assault, especially a youthful one assaulted in a familial context, may not report the offence in a timely manner for reasons such as feelings of shame and fear. In the current case, there were plausible legitimate explanations for her initial non-disclosure, said the court, which also comprised Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang. There were, however, other aspects of  her account that the court found troubling. It noted that her first disclosure of the alleged offences, to her boyfriend sometime between 2010 and early 2011, was ""forced"" out of her by him. She next told her mother about the abuse in mid-2011, also the result of ""pestering"" by her boyfriend, who admitted that he had pressured her into it. The court also pointed out a major inconsistency regarding the length of time during which the offences were repeated. The alleged victim told the police that all the sexual assaults had ended by May or June 2011. However, she told her brother that the rapes had taken place almost right up to the time she first spoke to him about them in December 2012. The prosecution relied on seven parking summonses to show that the man drove the prime mover. The court, however, found that while the summonses established that the prime mover had been parked near the flat, they did not prove that the man had driven the vehicle. The court also noted that the accuser had initially not identified the prime mover as the site of the offences. It was only when the police showed her two photographs of prime movers owned by the man's employer that she identified the one that bore the name of the company. While the prosecution argued that various discrepancies in the man's testimony demonstrated guilt, the court stressed that the burden lay squarely with the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

He also molested the woman when she went to his flat, hoping that the images and videos could be deleted. The NSF, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his former girlfriend's identity, was sentenced on Thursday (Aug 8) to 11 months' jail and three strokes of the cane. The 23-year-old man pleaded guilty to one count each of molestation and criminal intimidation. The court heard that the pair were in a relationship from 2014 to 2016, but the man decided to rekindle their relationship in October last year. He started sending the 23-year-old woman threatening text messages, stating that he still had numerous images and videos of her in the nude. On Oct 24, he asked the woman to meet him at his Serangoon North flat on Oct 26. When she refused and asked if they could meet at a bus stop instead, the man threatened to leak her nude videos. Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Sue Jean said that ""the accused also repeatedly alluded to wanting to have sexual intercourse with the victim on Oct 26, 2018"", despite her saying at least five times within eight minutes of the conversation that she did not want to do so. Later that day, the man asked the woman to show him a video of her topless. When she refused, he replied: ""Leakage"". He also threatened to send the nude photos to her current boyfriend if she did not comply with the demands. The woman decided to lodge a police report that night. While she was telling a police officer about her ordeal, the man continued sending her threatening messages. He also sent over a picture of her performing a sexual act but due to a ""self-destruct"" timer, it expired before the officer could keep a record of it. Two days later, the woman decided to go to the man's flat - as he had demanded - because she hoped the compromising images and videos could be deleted. DPP Goh told District Judge Marvin Bay: ""She was... afraid of what the accused would do to her and thus asked her boyfriend and two other female friends to wait for her outside the house."" When the NSF molested her in his room, she texted her boyfriend for help. The man was later arrested by police. The court heart that the woman has difficulty sleeping at night following this incident. Defence lawyer T. M. Sinnadurai pleaded for an 11-month jail term but no caning. He told Judge Bay that his client is ""truly remorseful for his actions and promises never to re-offend."" Offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. "

In adding the extra jail term to the man's original sentence of 23½ years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, the Court of Appeal said: ""We have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the appellant and the  The court said the man's actions were clear instances of abusing the process and a ""significant uplift"" in sentence was warranted. ""Those who abuse the process of the court must bear the due consequences of their actions,"" said the court, which comprised Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Tay Yong Kwang. The court also referred the witness to the Public Prosecutor for investigation into possible acts of perjury. The 45-year-old appellant, a former food stall assistant, started serving his sentence after the court rejected his request for deferment in view of the Hari Raya Haji public holiday next Monday (Aug 12). He was convicted and sentenced in 2017 for committing various sexual acts against his daughter at home between 2011 and 2014, when she was between 11 and 13 years old. He cannot be named to protect her identity. A key element of his defence was that it was impossible for him to have committed the penetrative acts because his penis was deformed as a result of botched enlargement procedures. Photographs of the man's penis, taken a month before his trial began in November 2016, show his misshapen genitalia. However, the crux of the matter is whether these abnormalities existed at the time of the offences. The girl and her mother each made drawings of his penis during the trial that contradicted the photographs. At his appeal last April, the man said he found two friends who could corroborate his story about the state of his penis at the time. One of them later backed out of testifying. The case was sent back to the trial judge to determine the veracity of the account of the other friend, Mr Muhammad Ridzwan Idris. Mr Ridzwan testified that he had seen the accused's penis in the toilet on Aug 3, 2013, when they were working at a stall at the Singapore Expo. He made a drawing of the penis that was highly similar to the photographs. His new evidence was rejected by the trial judge in January. On Thursday, the Court of Appeal agreed that the further evidence was incredible, should be rejected and amounted to an abuse of the court process. The court said it was unbelievable for the man to have had chance encounters with two separate witnesses who had allegedly seen his penis at the time of the offences. It was especially suspicious, said the court, that the man happened to bump into the two witnesses several days before various hearing dates and filing deadlines. The court also noted that the man and Mr Ridzwan gave inconsistent accounts of their chance encounter. It was also implausible, said the court, that the witness could pinpoint the exact day he had seen the man's penis so many years ago, without explaining how he could remember with such precision and confidence. The court added that it beggared belief that Mr Ridzwan, who took only a sidelong glance in the toilet, was able to draw both a lateral and frontal view of the penis which was suspiciously similar to the photographs.

Mr Aalishaan, 48, felt ""very alarmed"" when he read the e-mail on Sept 27 last year as it contained highly confidential data that could severely tarnish the company's reputation. He alerted police, who traced Nagarajan and arrested him three days later. Nagarajan, 36, pleaded guilty to one count each of harassment and dishonest misappropriation of property. He had spent 15 years working at the bank but is no longer employed there. Nagarajan could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $5,000 for harassment. But in his sentencing remarks, District Judge Marvin Bay said: ""The fact that (Nagarajan) deleted the (e-mail) account immediately after sending the message makes it unlikely that (he) was operating with a view to financial gain. ""The facts show that Mr Nagarajan had been genuinely stressed over the retrenchment exercise he was assigned to undertake and these stresses had misdirected him toward committing the two criminal acts."" Quoting a medical report on Thursday, defence lawyer Chooi Jing Yen told Judge Bay that his client's judgment had been impaired when he committed the offences as he was feeling stressed over the retrenchment exercise. Deputy Public Prosecutor Etsuko Lim told the court that workers had pleaded with Nagarajan not to terminate their employment, and he tried to persuade his line manager to discontinue the retrenchment exercise - but his line manager told him that it was a necessary cost-cutting measure. Nagarajan was at his workplace in Changi Business Park Crescent on Sept 26 last year when he found an unattended iPhone belonging to a colleague. He took the device and inserted its SIM card into his own mobile phone the next day. The Indian national then created an anonymous e-mail account and prepared an article titled ""Is Standard Chartered failing in its digital transformation agenda?"" on his office laptop. He also got hold of a report from his workplace shared drive, deleted its contents and keyed in his own input. Nagarajan sent the article to Mr Aalishaan later that day, threatening to publish it on social media if he did not agree to pay him $500,000 by 11am on Sept 28 last year. Soon after, Nagarajan deleted both a file containing the article and the e-mail account. He also got rid of his mobile phone at a jetty in East Coast Park. Nagarajan was arrested on Sept 30. "

There was also no food or water and three puppies later died. They were found dehydrated with inflammatory conditions within their lungs and hearts. The 26-year-old Singaporean was sentenced on Wednesday (Aug 7) to 32 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to one count each of importing the puppies from Malaysia without a licence, and conveying them in a manner that subjected them to unnecessary suffering. The court heard that on Dec 8 last year, Phua's friend, known only as Alex, offered him $1,000 to smuggle dogs from Johor Baru to Singapore. Phua accepted the offer and drove to Malaysia in a rented car on Dec 10. He met a man at a carpark and the latter transferred 11 poodles and one golden retriever to the vehicle. The puppies were placed inside the compartment in the boot and the hole was covered with a spare tyre. While returning to Singapore, Phua was stopped for a routine check at the Tuas Checkpoint at around 3.30am the next day. When questioned by an officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, he stated that he had nothing to declare. The officer inspected the car and discovered the puppies, which were not microchipped. The puppies were seized and handed over to an officer from the quarantine department of the then Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). He found that they appeared sleepy and lethargic and showed signs of being sedated. Three poodles died while in quarantine. Defence lawyer Choo Si Sen pleaded for leniency and told District Judge Adam Nakhoda that his client was a first-time offender. He said: ""He was not involved in placing the 12 puppies in the car... He was only instructed to drive... into Singapore. ""While the accused was promised $1,000 to deliver those puppies, he never received that amount. Judge Nakhoda said that Singapore is free from rabies, unlike Malaysia. By committing the offence, Phua could have introduced a ""very serious"" disease here, he added. The World Health Organisation has estimated that the number of human deaths caused by rabies - a fatal viral disease transmitted through the bite of an infected animal - is 60,000 each year. For conveying animals in a manner that subjected them to unnecessary suffering, first-time offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $10,000.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Asoka Markandu said in his submissions that Cheng, who was her registered employer, had a habit of brushing against or touching the woman when he walked past. The DPP added that the nature of these contacts were ""brief and innocent"", such that the maid did not have any cause to be concerned. Cheng and the maid were left alone in the flat after his wife, two children and parents-in-law flew to China for their holiday at around 3am on Nov 27, 2016. He molested her inside a bedroom the next day by placing his head on her right shoulder. During the trial, the maid had testified that she ""didn't feel anything"" after he molested her for the first time. ""I didn't think of anything... because he's my boss and he's an elder... I regard him as my elder... So that's why I didn't think about (it)."" Cheng struck again at around 5.40pm the next day, when he hugged her from behind in the master bedroom toilet and touched her right breast. She felt ""angry and scared"" this time round, the court heard. She had told the court: ""I was scared and just (did) not know what to do. Then I felt shame."" Cheng later left the flat and she told her trainer at the maid agency about what had happened. Cheng returned home at around 9pm and found the maid crying. She told him she wanted to be sent back to her agency. The firm's branch manager later told Cheng about the maid's allegations. The manager also advised him to accompany the maid to a police station and file a report. Cheng lodged one on Nov 30, 2016, but lied in his report, claiming that the maid had accused him of rape instead. DPP Asoka said: ""It is suggested that the reason the accused lied in his police report was because he wanted the victim to appear as someone who had made a frivolous and false claim against her employer."" During the trial, the defence, led by lawyer T.M. Sinnadurai, had asserted that the maid had a motive to falsely implicate Cheng. Among other reasons, the defence said she was unhappy with him, as she missed her family back in Myanmar. In response, the DPP said: ""There is no evidence whatsoever to support the assertions that the victim was unhappy with her employer."" Before giving his verdict on Wednesday, Judge Foo said he accepted the maid's evidence, as it was convincing. It was not stated where the maid is now. A CAAS spokesman said that the authority suspended Cheng after he was charged in court in July 2017. ""CAAS is unable to comment on the case as it is before the courts,"" said the spokesman. Cheng was offered bail of $15,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Sept 12. For each count of molestation, he can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. "

Bangladeshis Rubel Mohammad, 26, and Bhuiyan Md Robius Sani, 30, were handed a cheating charge each. According to court documents, the pair allegedly engaged in a conspiracy with each other in May to cheat a man identified as Mr Rahman Aminur of $300. Rubel and Bhuiyan are accused of duping him into believing that they could purportedly help him apply for a job with the Ministry of Manpower. Mr Rahman's details were not revealed in court documents. In a statement on Tuesday evening, the police said preliminary investigations revealed that there were at least 30 similar cases reported islandwide. They received reports between September last year and last month. These reports came from parties who were allegedly cheated by an agent who had promised to help them secure jobs in Singapore in exchange for a fee. The police said the victims would receive fake employment application letters after they made their payments via bank transfers. The agent would then become uncontactable soon after. Through investigations, officers from the Central Police Division managed to establish the identities of the two alleged conmen and arrested them on Monday. No bail was offered to the two Bangladeshis on Wednesday and they are now in remand. They will be back in court on Aug 13. Offenders convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.

The court heard that insurance firm Manulife Singapore was then cheated into disbursing $4,450 in total. Charles Loo Boon Ann, 30, who was a director of the Chiropractic Focus Group (CFG) but is now its shareholder, was sentenced on Tuesday (Aug 6) to eight months' jail. He pleaded guilty to six cheating charges involving $4,250 and six patients. Another 11 similar charges linked to the remaining amount and six other patients were considered during sentencing. He committed the offences between 2017 and last year. His alleged accomplices are Priscilla Tien Ling, 27, and Mike Chew Jun Yong, 37, whose cases are still pending. A search on the General Insurance Association Of Singapore's website reveals no information about the pair. Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Sng told the court that the three Singaporeans knew one another in early 2017 and discussed ways they could work together in their respective businesses. The DPP said they then agreed on a plan in which Loo would refer patients seeking treatment at CFG for pre-existing conditions to the pair. According to court documents, as part of the ruse, Tien and Chew would then sell Manulife personal accident insurance policies to these patients. The patients would then return to CFG and claim the cost of treatments against the policies they had purchased. DPP Sng told District Judge Carol Ling: ""The accused and co-accused persons were aware at all material times that the Manulife personal accident insurance policies did not cover pre-existing conditions and that the cost of the patients' treatment at CFG therefore could not be claimed against the policies. Nevertheless, the accused and co-accused persons facilitated claims made by the patients."" On Feb 27, 2017, Ms Tan Bee Ai visited CFG's outlet in Tampines Central for pre-existing back pain and Loo attended to her. She returned about two months later and he advised her to sign up for a $2,000 treatment package. When she told Loo she found this expensive, he advised her to sign up for an insurance policy and she could then claim for the cost of her treatment. When she agreed, Loo forwarded her details to his two alleged accomplices. Tien later contacted Ms Tan who signed up for a Manulife insurance policy and its inception date was April 28, 2017. About two months later, Loo prepared a medical report falsely stating that Ms Tan had suffered lower back pain and stiffness after she fell in her kitchen in May that year . The DPP said Tien then submitted a personal accident claim form to Manulife on July 6, 2017, which contained this bogus information. The claim was also submitted with a CFG invoice dated June 17 that year which stated that Ms Tan's treatment had cost $1,000. Manulife eventually paid Ms Tan $1,000 for this claim. The court heard that Loo, Tien and Chew also used a similar method to dupe the insurance firm on five other occasions. These cases involved CFG's other patients, identified as Ms Tan Sook Koon, Ms Goh Keng Lian, a 13-year-old boy who cannot be named due to his age, as well as a husband and wife pair, Mr Choo Joon Hin and Madam Lee Seow Joo. It was not mentioned in court if these patients were aware that they were involved in a scam. On Tuesday, DPP Sng said Loo had played a ""crucial role"" in the ruse and urged the judge to sentence him to eight months' jail. Loo was represented by lawyers Ravinderpal Singh and Trent Ng who pleaded for a four-month jail term. In their mitigation plea, the lawyers stressed that their client had attempted to offer full restitution to Manulife. They added: ""Restitution was not made in the present case only because of Manulife's persistent refusal to accept any restitution from the accused."" For each count of cheating, Loo could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

Toh, 64, then went straight to a nearby budget shop, bought a pair of slippers and a knife. About 14 minutes after the first fight ended,  Toh rushed towards the younger man, sparking a second fight that ended with Mr Goh being knifed multiple times, including a fatal stab wound on his upper arm that went through a major blood vessel. Both fights were partly captured on closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage on the morning of July 9, 2016. On Tuesday (Aug 6), Toh, now 67, went on trial in the High Court to contest a charge of murdering Mr Goh at the coffee shop at Lorong 23 Geylang. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment or the death sentence. ""I did not kill anyone,"" he said in court in Mandarin. Prosecutors, however, contend that from the circumstances leading up to the second fight, CCTV footage and medical evidence, it was clear that Toh had intended to stab Mr Goh. This included intentionally inflicting the fatal wound, which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. ""This was a vicious and violent revenge attack with a knife, which resulted in death,"" said the opening statement of the prosecution, led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Lee. Numerous surveillance video clips were played in court, including footage showing a limited view of the two fights and Toh buying the slippers and knife at the budget shop. The court heard that both men frequented the Geylang area. On the morning of July 9 that year, Toh stopped his bicycle outside the Geylang coffee shop and felt that Mr Goh, who was having breakfast inside, was staring at him. When Toh asked Mr Goh if he was selling Chinese medicine, the younger man shouted vulgarities and retorted along the lines of ""do I look like a drug peddler?"". At the time, Mr Goh was on the phone with a friend, who heard part of the exchange. Toh then got down from his bike and the two men came to blows. During the one-minute fight, Mr Goh used Toh's own bike to hit him. Toh retaliated by hitting the back of Mr Goh's head with a wooden stick he grabbed from a parked lorry. But Toh lost his grip on the stick, and both men traded blows with their bare hands, before the older man fled the scene. After the fight, Mr Goh went to a back alley to clean himself up with a towel and water, spoke to his friend on the phone, and walked back to the main road of Lorong 23 Geylang. But Toh returned armed with a knife and charged towards Mr Goh, who picked up the stick from the earlier fight. Mr Goh was stabbed in the right upper arm, the scalp, and the chest. His face was also sliced and his hands were cut when he tried to defend himself from the knife attack. The fight lasted two minutes, and Toh left the scene with his shirt stained with blood and again with only one slipper, on his left foot. He took off his shirt, put on one he took from a clothesline, and went to a supermarket at Boon Keng Road to buy another pair of slippers. Meanwhile, Mr Goh laid down on the road and rested his head on the kerb, while passers-by called for the police and ambulance. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. The knife, with a 14.5cm-long blade, was recovered at the scene, sheathed in its plastic cover. An autopsy found that Mr Goh bled to death from the stab wound to his arm which went through the brachial artery and cut the basilic vein. Toh was arrested 12 days later on July 21 at Labrador Park MRT station after the police received a tip-off that he had been sighted nearby. He admitted that he evaded police detection by seeking shelter under a bridge near the Bendemeer area. He initially confessed to stabbing Mr Goh in the stomach but later omitted this in his police statements. Toh, who is defended by assigned lawyer Wong Seow Pin, is likely to argue that he did not inflict the fatal wound, did not have the intention to cause the fatal wound, or was acting in self defence. However, the prosecution contends that these defences are ""unsustainable"". The trial continues. "

Giving her findings about the death of 68-year-old Madam Ong Lim in September 2016, State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam said on Monday (Aug 5) that the handbrake had to be pulled up for nine clicks for it to become effective. According to a mechanic, this is three or four more than a normal brake would need. She also noted that the bus, used as a hearse by the Singapore Muslim Casket and Marble Contractor, was almost 19 years old at the time of the accident and subject to half-yearly inspections. State Coroner Kamala, who found Madam Ong's death to be an ""unfortunate traffic misadventure"", said that the vehicle's last motor vehicle inspection prior to the accident was carried out on April 19 that year. It was then certified as having complied with the statutory requirements under the Road Traffic Act. ""It would appear from the mechanical inspection that the handbrake, which was ineffective, had not been fully applied when it was parked on a downward slope along Bukit Panjang Ring Road,"" she said. ""The weight of the bus had caused the motor bus to roll down the slope, mount and dismount the kerb on the left before colliding into Madam Ong and causing her serious injuries which resulted in her death."" The driver, 62-year-old Mr Mohamed Ramlee Mohamed Ali, had earlier stated that before the tragedy occurred at around 10am that day, he had driven the bus to the far left of the three-lane Bukit Panjang Ring Road, as he wanted to go to a nearby mosque to pray. Mr Ramlee said he parked on a slope then pulled up the handbrake until ""it could be pulled no more"", turned off the engine and alighted. At around 10am, a witness saw the vehicle travelling down the slope before stopping along a grass verge before a slip road. The man did not see it hitting Madam Ong but he later spotted her lying face-up on the ground. She was taken to the National University Hospital in a critical state and died of multiple injuries at around 11.30am that day. Mechanic Lim Kean Keong inspected the bus later that month and found that he had to use both hands to pull the handbrake all the way up to nine clicks. Senior automotive engineer Mr Tan Jit Shee, who also inspected the vehicle, found the handbrake was ineffective if not pulled to the maximum nine clicks, and the bus could move forward. He stated in his report: ""I would like to state that at nine clicks, the handbrake is too high, as extra effort is required to pull to nine clicks. The high handbrake is due to wear and tear of parts and improper adjustment of handbrake height."" Mr Tan also stated that a vehicle parked on a slope should have at least a choke block placed behind a wheel. On Monday, Mr Ramlee's lawyer, Mr Deepak Natverlal told The Straits Times that his client had earlier been charged with causing Madam Ong's death by performing a negligent act. However, the driver was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on the first day of the trial in January last year after the lawyer told the court that there could have been issues with the handbrake. This means Mr Ramlee can be prosecuted if new evidence were to surface. Mr Ramlee, who was also present in court on Monday, said that he is still working for the Singapore Muslim Casket and Marble Contractor but is now driving a van. "

The passenger, Vijayan Mathan Gopal, 39, later molested a stewardess by touching her buttock, placing his hand on her right thigh and cupping her face with his hands. After a trial, District Judge Salina Ishak found the Indian national guilty of three molestation charges on Monday (Aug 5). The Singapore permanent resident committed these offences between 4am and 8.14am on Nov 2, 2017. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jane Lim said in her submissions that commercial air travel involves passengers ""packed into a confined space... for a period of time"" with ""no ready means of escape and immediate assistance from law enforcement is practically impossible"". The DPP added: ""This was the very predicament the victim, an air stewardess, found herself (in) when she was molested by the accused while working."" The court heard that following the take-off, Vijayan had an argument with another crew member, as he had refused to pay after ordering food and red wine. DPP Lim said it was the carrier's policy to collect payment before heating up its passengers' orders. The stewardess, who cannot be named due to a gag order, stepped in to defuse the situation and agreed to serve Vijayan his order before he paid for it. Despite this, he continued to demand her attention by repeatedly pressing the call light even though she had to attend to another passenger who was feeling faint at the time. Her colleague tried to attend to Vijayan but he insisted on talking to ""that female steward"". The DPP said: ""According to the victim, the situation was 'very urgent' because there was a medical emergency that required her to page for medical assistance... and a drunk passenger that required her attention. ""After a nurse came forward to assist in the medical emergency, the victim attended to the accused. She knelt down to be at his eye level, placed her arm on the arm rest and told the accused firmly not to press the call light again."" The court heard that Vijayan suddenly asked the stewardess where she lived and told her: ""You are so beautiful."" After that, he cupped her face with both hands, causing her to feel ""angry, uncomfortable and very disgusted"". However, she could not push him away and she leaned back instead, as he was a passenger. He then told her: ""Do not throw your anger at me... I'm the boss of the flight."" When she tried to stand up, he placed his hand on her right thigh ""with strong force"" and touched her buttock before she walked away. The stewardess told the plane captain about what happened and asked him to alert the airport police. She later submitted a report to Scoot about the incident. During the trial, Vijayan, who is represented by lawyers Ramesh Selvaraj and Nicholas Kam, denied molesting the woman. Instead, he claimed that she had fabricated the whole incident to suppress his complaint against her colleague about the ""poor service"" he had received. He is now out on bail of $5,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Aug 28. For each count of molestation, he can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. "

Yap Kok Hua, 55, was also banned from driving for five years yesterday. Yap, who is no longer a taxi driver, pleaded guilty last month to negligent driving and causing the death of Ms Kathy Ong Kai Ting, 19, as well as negligent driving and causing grievous hurt to the three other passengers in the taxi. They were Mr Zon Lim Thou Jung, Mr Lim Jin Jie and Mr Ting Jun Heng, all 22 years old. On April 19 last year, the four passengers had boarded Yap's taxi at Clementi Mall in Commonwealth Avenue West at around 7.30pm. They instructed him to take them to Tembusu College at NUS. When Yap arrived at the cross junction of Commonwealth Avenue, he stopped the taxi when the traffic lights turned red. When the lights turned green, he moved forward into the right-turn pocket. He stopped and checked for vehicles coming from the opposite direction. The green right-turn arrow had not come on. Yap saw a car coming towards him from the opposite direction at a speed of about 92kmh to 97kmh, driven by Ng Li Ning, 21, but decided to make the discretionary right turn anyway. Ng was unable to avoid the taxi and collided with it. The court heard earlier that had Ng been driving within the speed limit of 70kmh, the accident could have been avoided. Ng has been charged with dangerous driving. His case is still pending. Ms Ong, who was seated in the rear-left passenger seat, was taken to the National University Hospital. She died of multiple injuries about three hours later. Mr Lim Jin Jie, who was seated in the rear-right of the taxi, was found with blood outside his brain and a spinal fracture, while Mr Zon Lim, who was seated in front, suffered a brain injury. Both men were hospitalised for eight days. Mr Ting, who was seated in the rear-centre passenger seat, suffered traumatic brain injury and arrived at the hospital in a vegetative state, the court heard. He was hospitalised for 54 days and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital after his discharge for rehabilitation. Yap was represented by lawyer Josephus Tan. In his sentencing remarks, District Judge Victor Yeo said he did not accept Yap's defence that since Ng had been speeding at the time of the accident, this lessened the taxi driver's culpability. This is because Yap's ""own ne-gligent conduct had resulted in the death of Ms Ong and caused grievous hurt to three others through no fault of theirs"", said District Judge Yeo. He added that he ""could not ignore"" Yap's past traffic offences, particularly his red-light violations on three occasions and speeding offences on two occasions.

The company, represented in court yesterday by its chief executive Zachary Wang Zizi, had been charged earlier with two counts of the same offence under the Parking Places Act in February. This brings the number of charges to 58. Currently, personal mobility device-sharing operators are not allowed to offer the devices for hire in public places without a licence or an exemption approved by the Minister for Transport. If convicted, the operator may be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed for up to six months. For each day the offence continues after conviction, it can also be fined up to an additional $500 a day or part of a day. On Feb 28, Neuron Mobility became the second e-scooter sharing firm to be charged with making its devices available for hire in public without a licence or exemption. As of Feb 25, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has impounded 144 devices from the company. Telepod was the first to be charged with the same offence on Feb 21. It is facing 25 charges, and almost 70 devices have been impounded by the LTA as of that day. Both firms have been operating in Singapore since 2017 under an exemption that allowed their devices to be used without a licence within specific areas under an agreement with land owners. Neuron Mobility and Telepod were among 13 e-scooter sharing firms vying for licences from the LTA allowing each company to run a fleet of up to 500 of the devices. While the LTA had earlier said it would announce in the second quarter of this year which companies would be granted the licence, this was delayed to the third quarter in the light of safety concerns. The LTA reminded licence applicants then that operators should refrain from deploying their personal mobility devices (PMDs) on private land if there was a high risk of the devices entering public space. Meanwhile, e-scooter retailer Samuel Tan Woon Yeow of Synergy Scooters also appeared in court yesterday for riding a PMD along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar on July 6. Under the Road Traffic Act, PMDs are not allowed to be used on roads. Tan, 37, was spotted by a Traffic Police patrol motorbike, and was subsequently stopped by the officer in Jalan Bahar at around 12.10am, said LTA prosecutor Ng Jun Kai.

He said the case is still under investigation by the Traffic Police and that Tan may face additional charges. Under the Road Traffic Act, the charge of riding a PMD on the road carries a maximum fine of $2,000, up to three months' jail, or both. "

In November 2011, Ms Khanifah arrived in Singapore from a village in Indramayu, West Java, to work as a maid for the couple.  While her relationship with the family started out well, her relationship with Zariah deteriorated in June 2012, as her employer began scolding her and physically abusing her.  The abuse, which lasted for about half a year, left Ms Khanifah with a deformed left ear, permanent and prominent scars on her forehead, at the back of her head and across her shoulders, and a left little finger that is functionally impaired.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wen Hsien asked District Judge Luke Tan to sentence Zariah to at least 13 years’ jail and Mohamad to at least 18 months’ jail for the “horrific abuse” that they inflicted on Ms Khanifah. “This is indubitably one of the worst cases of maid abuse in Singapore’s recent history... A strong message must be sent out that such treatment of domestic workers within the home cannot be tolerated by the courts,” said DPP Tan. She added that the victim not only suffered physically, but psychologically too, through the “reign of terror” that Zariah instituted to “reinforce her power and control over the victim, and to bully and oppress her into submission”. Some of the other things Zariah did included not allowing Ms Khanifah to call home or use the phone, and barring her from speaking to the neighbours. Ms Khanifah was also made to stay in the kitchen toilet whenever visitors came to the flat. As a result, significant psychological harm was inflicted on her, said DPP Tan. The prosecution highlighted how Ms Khanifah, in a victim impact statement recorded on July 29, said the abuse left her feeling traumatised. “Even at the court hearings, when I saw her, I felt very scared because I was reminded of what happened. I was scared if I was going to be attacked by her again,” she said. Ms Khanifah also revealed that the disfigurations left her feeling embarrassed about how she looks, adding that she believes people are disgusted with the way she now looks. The abuse was discovered when Ms Khanifah returned to Indonesia in December 2012. Her husband saw her injuries and notified the maid agency. During the trial, Zariah disputed the allegations of abuse, arguing that she had suffered two strokes and was paralysed on her left side.  But the prosecution said Zariah did not suffer from any mental illness at the time of the offences. DPP Tan also said medical evidence showed that Zariah still has normal functioning and strength in the right side of her body. In his sentencing remarks, District Judge Tan said the couple isolated Ms Khanifah from her friends and family in an attempt to force the domestic worker into submission.  He added that “sadly, both persons have demonstrated no remorse” for their actions, despite having had past offences of maid abuse.  “To prevent a serious escalation of violence, the sentence must reflect the gravity of the offences,” said the judge.

On Wednesday, he pleaded guilty to seven charges, including sexual penetration of a minor and committing obscene act with a young person, with 21 other charges taken into consideration. Arun preyed on young girls between 12 and 15 on social media. Around February 2016, the 22-year-old NSF befriended one of his victims, then 12, through Instagram. They exchanged numbers in April and he sent her lewd messages several times commenting on her body, saying she had ""voluptuous curves"". He also pestered her for naked pictures or videos of herself showering and pressed her to meet him at his house or hotels for ""cuddles"" or sex. He repeatedly reminded her not to reveal their chat records to anyone and also told her that he was a policeman. In May 2016, the girl finally relented and sent a photo of herself in her brassiere, but he was not satisfied and asked her to remove it. After the incident, the victim said she was depressed and regretted giving in to his request. Just a few months later, he befriended another victim, then 14, through a WhatsApp group chat. He told her he was from the ""Home Team"" and asked her for her age. He pestered her to meet up, but she rejected all of his requests, and she eventually blocked him as she found his messages annoying. But he continued to send her messages on Instagram. In February 2017, the victim said she would be playing truant and skipping her co-curricular activities. He asked her to meet up at his house and she agreed. When she reached his house, he hugged her, and they went to the bedroom and lay on the bed. He kissed her lips, cheeks, and neck. He then sexually assaulted her. The victim tried to move away from him, but he pulled her closer, and when he left the room, she sent text messages to her friend to call the police. She then made up an excuse to go home. The driver of the private-hire car she was in noticed that she was trembling and took her to make a police report when she told him what had happened. In 2017, when Arun was arrested for his offences against his 14-year-old victim, the police found 720 upskirt photos in his phone. He will be sentenced on Aug 13. "

On Thursday (Aug 1), the court heard that cracks were first found on June 16, 2017, before more were discovered on June 30. The Pan-Island Expressway viaduct collapsed on July 14, 2017, resulting in the death of 31-year-old Chinese worker Chen Yinchuan. Ten other workers were hurt - two seriously - during the incident. The public prosecutor said the cracks were discovered when girders, which form the part of the viaduct which was to be cast, were placed on them. The cracks were found on corbels - which are support structures - at Pier 41, and later on at Pier 42 as well. The area between the piers was to have been the longest span of the viaduct. By early July, it emerged that the cracks, which were assessed to be structural in nature, were the result of inadequate corbel strength defined during the design stage of the construction. The corbel strength for Pier 41 and 42 was allegedly inadequate for the load the support structures were supposed to bear. The design for corbels at eight other piers was also said to be inadequate, with some at only a quarter of their required strength. Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang said in his opening statement on Thursday that ""eight out of the 10 piers with permanent corbels would have developed significant structural cracks leading to sudden brittle failure and collapse when the viaduct was opened to traffic"". The court heard that Robert Arianto Tjandra of subcontractor CPG Consultants became aware of the errors by early July 2017 but he did not inform Or Kim Peow Contractors (OKP), the main construction company behind the project. He also did not redesign the corbels but attempted instead to take remedial steps on-site, including strengthening the supporting structures - steps which were allegedly illegal and proved futile. When concrete was poured to cast the span of viaduct between piers 40 and 41  on the early morning of July 14, 2017, a section of the viaduct collapsed. The hearing continued in the afternoon with engineer Yeung Chun Keung taking the stand. Mr Yeung, who was the technical director of OKP during the incident, told the court that the corbels were “underdesigned”. Now retired, the prosecution witness compared the design of the viaduct with another on the Tampines Expressway (TPE) which he had worked on. Although the two viaduct structures were “similar”, the difference in corbel design was very obvious, he said. For the TPE viaduct, the reinforcement steel bars (rebars) within the corbel were 20mm in diameter and set 150mm apart. But in the PIE viaduct which collapsed, the rebars were 16mm in diameter and set 200mm apart. This, he said, meant the PIE viaduct was weaker. The corbel was designed to take less than half its intended load, he added, describing the corbel design as not common. Besides Tjandra, OKP's project director Allen Yee and project engineer Wong Kiew Hai are also on trial over the collapse. Yee and Wong are charged with not stopping work despite knowledge of the errors, and for obstructing justice by deleting WhatsApp messages and photos relating to the cracks. Tjandra face five charges in total. OKP was fined $10,000 on Tuesday for carrying out unauthorised strengthening works on the corbels while accredited checker, Leong Sow Hon, was sentenced to six moths' jail on July 4. Leong, who was appointed as checker by the Land Transport Authority, is the managing director of Calibre Consulting Singapore. The group managing director of OKP, Or Toh Wat, was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in court on Wednesday for all his three charges in relation to the collpase. "

The three charges were withdrawn a day after OKP was fined $10,000 for carrying out unauthorised strengthening works on the permanent corbels, or support structures, of the PIE viaduct. On Tuesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang said investigations by the Building and Construction Authority found that OKP had conducted unauthorised works on the structure near Upper Changi Road. The viaduct collapsed on July 14, 2017, resulting in the death of Chinese worker Chen Yinchuan, 31. Ten other workers were hurt, two seriously, during the incident. Under the Building Control Act, Mr Or, 51, could have been fined up to $200,000, jailed for up to two years, or both, for carrying out the unauthorised works. In addition, for not notifying the Commissioner of Building Control about the contravention of the Act - despite knowing that the works had not been authorised - he could have been fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to 12 months, or both. The third charge under the Workplace Safety and Health Act carries a fine of up to $200,000, two years' jail, or both. Before the court session yesterday morning, Mr Or was given conditional warnings by officers from the Ministry of Manpower and the Building and Construction Authority, according to his lawyer Navin Shanmugaraj Thevar from Davinder Singh Chambers. OKP will face trial today to contest its remaining charge over causing the death of the Chinese worker and the injuries of the other 10 workers under the Workplace Safety and Health Act.

They are: Robert Arianto Tjandra, 46, of subcontractor CPG Consultants, OKP project engineer Wong Kiew Hai, 31, and OKP project director Allen Yee Chee Keong, 49. Yee was also granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal yesterday for carrying out unauthorised works.

In a written judgment yesterday, Justice Ang Cheng Hock described the case as ""an unfortunate one, not only because of the number of serious allegations made by the sisters against each other, but also because they were previously close and now have fallen out with each other over money"". Elder sister Ang Siew Fah, also known as Diana, an accountant, did not deny that she owed US$313,827.30 to younger sister Ang Bee Yian, also known as Jessie. The sum represents money that Jessie had entrusted with Diana to invest in foreign currency, and the returns. Diana got her accountancy degree in 1977, while Jessie completed her GCE A levels in 1979. Diana also accepted that Jessie had paid $200,580 in cash for a 25 per cent share in a unit at Northvale condominium. She, however, claimed that she had funded more than $2 million for Jessie's margin trading activities between 2006 and 2016, and that all of this was completely lost. Diana claimed Jessie had agreed that the trading losses could be set off against the US$313,827.30 and the 25 per cent share in the Northvale unit. However, the judge rejected Diana's claims, saying that they were ""quite unbelievable"". He found it incredible that Diana would continue to bankroll Jessie's trading without question despite mounting losses over the years. He also noted the two sisters regularly communicated by text message and e-mail, but there was no mention of the funding and set-off arrangements alleged by Diana. On the contrary, there were text messages in which Diana acknowledged that she owed money to Jessie. The judge said Jessie did not come across as someone who was sophisticated or knowledgeable about margin trading. In contrast, Diana was a seasoned investor. There was evidence that Diana controlled the trading accounts. E-mails were sent from the bank to Diana when there were margin calls, and it was Diana who phoned the bank officers about them. The dispute over the sum of money arose in 2009, when Jessie transferred $450,000 into a joint account with Diana to invest in foreign currency. After the investments matured, Diana transferred US$313,827.30 - the converted sum due to Jessie - to her own fixed deposit account. In an e-mail in September 2012, Jessie asked Diana to return the money. The amount was not repaid despite repeated demands. In one text message in 2013, Jessie said: ""I'm not a fool anymore... Come to money u got no conscience. I want my money back."" Separately, the two also fell out over the Northvale unit they bought in the late 1990s with another sister, Madam Ang Siew Chin, also known as Eunice. Diana paid 50 per cent of the purchase price, while Jessie and Eunice each paid 25 per cent. The property, registered only in the names of Diana and Eunice, was rented out, with the proceeds shared among the trio. In May 2016, Jessie demanded that Diana transfer 25 per cent of the legal ownership of the property to her, or that the property be sold and the sale proceeds distributed among the three sisters. In August 2016, Diana stopped paying Jessie her share of the proceeds and stopped providing her with an account of the rental earned. Yesterday, the court ordered Diana to return the money and to take steps to rectify the land register to properly reflect that Jessie has a 25 per cent share of the apartment. "

He had also written that ""there is a sense of when to get it out"" in a message when she told him she was worried about getting pregnant. District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said that he accepted the victim's testimony, as it was consistent and supported by the text messages she exchanged with the man.

He had also wrote that ""there is a sense of when to get it out"" in one text message, when the girl told him that she was worried about getting pregnant. During the trial, he gave three reasons for not having sex with the girl before her 16th birthday: that it was illegal to have sex with a minor, that she was unwilling to have premarital sex and he respected her view on this, and that they were both afraid of her getting pregnant.

Yesterday, Malaysian Tean Tai Tee, 25, was jailed for two years for criminal breach of trust. Tean's work duties included keeping an account of the money inside two safes at Hougang Stadium - one in the office and the other in the clubhouse. She also issued cash floats for the jackpot machines. She had access to the keys for both safes, which contained the club's sales revenue and earnings. On Oct 6 last year, Tean received a ""friend"" request over Facebook from a Lily Tan and accepted the request. Subsequently, the person asked Tean if she was interested in a part-time job which involved the use of Tean's bank account for transactions on the person's behalf. She would earn a 5 per cent commission from each transaction. Tean agreed and gave her bank account details to both Lily Tan and the latter's colleague, known only as Steven in court documents. Nearly a week later, she began receiving money in her bank accounts, and each time, she would transfer it to Steven as soon as possible. The following month, her bank accounts were frozen, and when she contacted the police, they told her that the transactions involving Lily Tan and Steven were being investigated. When she informed Steven about it, he told her to give a false account to the police that she had taken loans from an unlicensed moneylender, and had allowed the moneylender to use her bank accounts to make transactions in lieu of loan repayments. Tean did so, and on Nov 26, was arrested. While out on bail, she contacted Steven, who told her he could help her resolve the matter for a fee of $100,000. This was eventually lowered to $30,000.

The three-judge court said the totality of the circumstances showed that Chan Lie Sian, 55, did not have a specific intention to kill 35-year-old William Tiah Hung Wai. Chan was convicted in the High Court in 2017 of committing murder with the intention of causing death, which carries the mandatory death penalty. The apex court yesterday downgraded the charge to murder with the intention of causing bodily injury, which could cause death. It sentenced Chan to life imprisonment, and not death, as the manner in which he acted did not show a blatant disregard for human life. On Jan 14, 2014, Chan, who is also known as Benny Seow, discovered that $6,500 of his money was missing and suspected that Mr Tiah was responsible. He summoned Mr Tiah to the brothel, a lodging house in Lorong 18 Geylang, intending to force a confession out of him. Chan repeatedly struck Mr Tiah on the head with a metal dumbbell rod even as the pimp fervently denied stealing the money, until he lost consciousness. Mr Tiah died a week later in hospital, a day short of his 36th birthday. A post-mortem found that there were 10 points of impact to the victim's head. Chan surrendered himself to the police two days after the assault. He was found guilty of murder in May 2017 after a High Court judge concluded that he had intended to kill the victim. Chan appealed against his conviction and sentence. His lawyer Wendell Wong presented reports from a forensic pathologist from Australia which said two of the impacts could have been caused by the victim hitting his head on ""intervening objects"", and not attributable to blows by Chan. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal, comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and judges of appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, concluded that Chan did not have a specific intention to kill the victim. The court noted that with no witnesses around and with the victim lying helpless on the bed, Chan had every opportunity to bring any such intention to kill to fruition. Yet, he did not do so. The court also noted that at one point, in the presence of another staff member, Chan splashed water on the victim to revive him, accused the victim of feigning death and said that he would attack him again when he regained consciousness. These actions made no sense if Chan had attacked the victim intending to kill him, said the court. Turning to the sentence, the court said the death sentence was not warranted as Chan had not acted in a manner that displayed blatant disregard for human life.

On Tuesday (July 30), Malaysian Tean Tai Tee, 25, was sentenced to two years' jail for criminal breach of trust. As an assistant at the club, Tean's duties included keeping an account of the money kept in the safes in its office at Block 247, Hougang Avenue 3, and its clubhouse at 100 Hougang Avenue 2. She was also responsible for issuing the cash floats for the club's jackpot machines. She had access to the keys for both safes, which contained the club's sales revenue and earnings before the cash was deposited into its bank account. On Oct 6 last year, Tean received a friend request over Facebook from a Lily Tan and accepted the request. Subsequently, the person asked Tean if she was interested in a part-time job, which involved the use of Tean's bank account for transactions on the person's behalf. In return, Tean would earn a commission of 5 per cent from each transaction. Tean agreed to the job and gave her bank account details to both Lily Tan and the latter's colleague, known only as Steven in court documents. Nearly a week later, she began receiving money in her bank accounts and each time, she would transfer it to Steven as soon as possible. The next month, Tean's bank accounts were frozen and when she contacted the police, they told her that the transactions involving Lily Tan and Steven were being investigated by the authorities. When she informed Steven about it, he told Tean to give a false account that she had taken loans from an unlicensed moneylender, and had allowed the moneylender to use her bank accounts to make transactions in lieu of loan repayments. On Nov 26, Tean gave the false account to the police. She was arrested and her passport impounded. When she was out on bail, she updated Steven on the status of the case. He told her that he could help her resolve the matter for a fee of $100,000, an amount that was eventually lowered to $30,000. Three days later, Tean took $2,000 to $3,000 from the club's office safe when the accountant, Ms Yap Mei Jan, was not around. As her actions were undetected, Tean became emboldened and continued taking money from the safe on an almost daily basis in increasing amounts until December last year, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Yanying. That month, Tean began taking money from the club's second safe, which was located at the clubhouse. Over a period of almost a month, Tean misappropriated $145,200 from the office safe and $133,000 from the clubhouse safe. Each time she took the cash from the safes, Tean would deposit it into bank accounts that were provided by Steven. The misappropriation was later discovered by Ms Yap on Dec 15 last year, after she realised there was a shortfall of $278,000 in the two safes. To date, Tean, who has been remanded since Dec 17 last year, has not made any restitution to the Hougang United Football Club. "

Chan was convicted in the High Court in 2017 of committing murder with the intention of causing death, which carries the mandatory death penalty. The apex court on Tuesday downgraded the charge to murder with the intention of causing bodily injury which could cause death. The court sentenced Chan to life imprisonment, and not death, as the manner in which he acted did not show a blatant disregard for human life. On January 14, 2014,  He summoned Mr Tiah to the brothel, a lodging house in Lorong 18 Geylang, intending to force a confession out of him. Chan, who is also known as Benny Seow, repeatedly struck Mr Tiah on the head with a metal dumbbell rod even as the pimp fervently denied stealing the money, until he lost consciousness. Mr Tiah died a week later in hospital, a day short of his 36th birthday. A post-mortem found that there were 10 points of  impact to the victim's head. Chan surrendered himself to the police two days after the assault. He was found guilty of murder in May 2017 after a High Court judge concluded that he had intended to kill the victim. Chan appealed against his conviction and sentence.  His lawyer Wendell Wong presented reports from a forensic pathologist from Australia, which said two of the impacts could have been caused by the victim hitting his head on “intervening objects”, and not attributable to blows by Chan. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal, comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, concluded that Chan did not specifically intend to kill the victim. The court noted that with no witnesses around and with the victim lying helpless on the bed, Chan had every opportunity to bring any such intention to kill to fruition. Yet, he did not do so.  The court also noted that at one point, in the presence of another staff member, Chan splashed water on the victim to revive him, accused the victim of feigning death and said that he would attack him again when he regained consciousness. These actions made no sense if Chan had attacked the victim intending to kill him, said the court. The court said the death sentence was not warranted as Chan had not acted in a manner that displayed blatant disregard for human life. The court found that Chan was not aware at the time of the attack or in its immediate aftermath, of the fatal nature of the victim’s injuries. Chan surrendered himself to the police precisely because he thought that the victim’s injuries were not fatal and had expected to be charged with causing grievous hurt, the court said. "

In the most serious incident, he punched a lorry driver, leaving the victim with facial fractures that required surgery. Fuad, 35, yesterday pleaded guilty to two counts of using criminal force, one count of voluntarily causing hurt and one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Two other charges involving harassment will be taken into consideration during sentencing at a later date. On Aug 12, 2016, Fuad and the lorry driver, Mr Pek Lian Hui, were in a car park at the National University of Singapore at 8.20pm when Fuad sounded the horn because he felt Mr Pek was driving too slowly ahead of him. A heated dispute ensued when Mr Pek, 52, a contractor, alighted from his lorry and approached Fuad. Fuad punched him several times in the face, head and stomach, and stopped the assault only after his mother and a passer-by intervened. Deputy Public Prosecutor Bjorn Tan said the incident left Mr Pek bleeding heavily from his injuries. A medical report later showed he had suffered fractures on his face and multiple facial abrasions, as well as swelling and tenderness. He received surgery to fix the broken bones four days after the assault. This charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt carries a jail term of up to 10 years, as well as a fine or caning. While Fuad was on bail, he got involved in a second road rage incident. On Dec 2, 2017, Fuad, who was working as a private hire driver, side-swiped a taxi which was driving towards a pick-up point in Clarke Quay, along River Valley Road. When both drivers alighted from their vehicles, an argument broke out. Fuad pointed his middle finger at the taxi driver, Mr Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed Shariff, 46, and pushed his left cheek, causing him to lose his balance. Mr Iqbal suffered bruising on his face and was given three days of medical leave. In the third road rage incident which occurred in February this year while he was still on bail, Fuad punched another taxi driver, Mr Tio Seng Sing, 71, in the face after cutting in front of his cab on a motorbike. The incident happened in Selegie Road. In yet another incident in May last year, Fuad pushed a man's shoulder, face and left elbow after the man accidentally bumped into him while walking in the opposite direction at VivoCity. DPP Tan urged the court to sentence Fuad to 18 months and 6 weeks' jail.

It ordered the building's main contractor Dragages Singapore and subcontractor Builders Shop to pay damages and fund the recladding, which could cost up to $20 million. The case involves an incident in 2004 in which a granite stone panel weighing more than 100kg fell off the facade of the Temasek Avenue building. A similar panel fell off in 2011. No one was hurt in the first incident, but Centennial Tower's owner Millenia sued Dragages and Builders Shop in 2006. A settlement was reached in 2007. Four years after that settlement, a second stone panel fell from the tower, hurting two passers-by and causing property damage. Millenia, represented by Senior Counsel Davinder Singh and others, began legal proceedings in 2012 against Dragages, Builders Shop and three engineering firms involved. Millenia failed in its suit against the engineering firms. One of them, Arup Singapore, represented by Morgan Lewis Stamford, won in a counterclaim for an indemnity relating to third-party claims that it faced over the rectification works. But the same ruling said Millenia was entitled to damages and recladding costs, which prompted Dragages, represented by Allen & Gledhill, to lodge an appeal. The firm argued that there was a ""temporal limit"" of 15 years on its obligations under a deed of warranty for its work. Dragages contended that this would mean it had no obligations in relation to defects that materialised after the expiry of the warranty period, which was until 2012, said court documents seen by The Straits Times. But Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong noted this month that such a point had not been made during the 57-day hearing for the case, and should not be taken during appeal. They cited two reasons for this ruling. One was that it would require new evidence to be introduced and examined, which is not generally allowed at the appeal stage. The second reason for refusing the application is that the new point was without merit, said the court. ""It is evident that the primary obligation on the appellant was to complete the project in a way that was fit for its purpose and free from defects,"" the court added. ""That purpose incorporated a design life of 50 years."" The trial exposed that there were defects and that the building was not fit for its design life of 50 years. "

Chinese national Zheng Guiling, 40, and Lim Peng Boon, a 64-year-old Singaporean, were convicted for offences under the Immigration Act. The ICA said that in September 2014, Zheng, who had been on a 30-day visit pass, was introduced to Lim through a friend. Zheng told Lim that she wanted to live and work in Singapore, to which Lim suggested that he could help her find a local husband who could enter into a marriage of convenience with her, and hence prolong her stay in the country. Lim told Zheng to pay $8,000 for the sham marriage arrangements, of which $6,000 would be given to her prospective husband. Later that same month, Lim introduced Zheng to Loh Chee Wai, a 54-year-old Singaporean man, who agreed to enter into a sham marriage. Zheng gave Lim $1,500 and paid the remaining $6,500 after the couple solemnised their marriage on Oct 22, 2014. Loh received $3,000 from Lim after the solemnisation, and was told by Lim that the remaining $3,000 would be paid by Zheng in instalments. Loh and Zheng were arrested by ICA officers on May 30 last year for entering into a marriage of convenience, said the ICA. They were each sentenced to six months' jail, with Loh sentenced on Dec 14 last year, and Zheng sentenced on July 17 this year. Lim was arrested on Jan 14 this year. Last Wednesday, he was jailed for 11 months and fined $8,000, which in default is two months' jail. The ICA said it takes a serious view of individuals trying to circumvent its system by engaging in, arranging or assisting to arrange marriages of convenience to obtain immigration facilities in Singapore. If convicted, a person may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to 10 years, or both. The ICA said it would continue to take firm enforcement action against errant couples or middlemen, and spare no effort in investigating such cases. Members of the public can report any suspected cases to the ICA on 1800-391-6150. Any information provided would be treated in strictest confidence. "

The latest suit was lodged earlier this month and throws more light on the seemingly lucrative deals Then Feng, 37, struck while working at leading law firm Walkers. Around February last year, Then was introduced to Mr Andrew Ling, director of two investment services firms - Providence Asset Management and another called 5 and 2 - according to court documents seen by The Straits Times. A mutual friend said Then could arrange for Walkers to provide services for facilitating business deals. Meanwhile, Then had incorporated a company called Walkers Professional Services (WPS), a name allegedly chosen for its similarity to the Walkers law firm. In mid-2018, Then told Mr Ling of a bank in Curacao that was available for purchase at US$8.5 million and that Walkers could represent the buyers. Then said he would also be a partner in the new venture. He used his Walkers law firm e-mail account to correspond with the Curacao party, who later agreed to sell two banks for US$8.5 million. Last October, around US$5.5 million was transferred to WPS in relation to the potential purchases. Mr Ling learnt only later that WPS was not related to Walkers. While one of the purchases was completed, the other fell through. Providence and 5 and 2 lodged a civil suit this month against Then, his wife and WPS. They want the unused sum of US$2.5 million refunded. They claim Then had ""confessed"" that he owned and controlled WPS when Mr Ling demanded the return of the outstanding funds. Around last month, he allegedly said he no longer had the money due to them. Providence and 5 and 2 claim the funds had been ""misappropriated"" and used for Then's own purposes. They also allege Then made ""fraudulent misrepresentations"" to induce them to transfer the funds. Then has faced other claims of misrepresentation. In March, two investors filed a case against him claiming over $1 million in loss of investment and profit, Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao reported. Then denies he misled them into making the investment. In another suit, forex trader Peh Wei Siang is claiming US$4.13 million, after he was allegedly misled into putting money into WPS' escrow account to be used to buy a bank in the United States. It includes money allegedly owed to a forex trading platform Mr Peh founded. Mr Peh, who also believed Then was acting for him as a Walkers lawyer, contacted the law firm directly about his money after learning in January or February this year that Then had left the law firm. Then resigned last year and did not renew his licence for practice, which expired in April, said Zaobao. In his counterclaim, Then said he ""did not at any time represent to Mr Peh or (the forex platform) that he was dealing with them in his capacity as a lawyer or employee of Walkers"", court documents showed. Walkers said it had no relation to WPS, nor records showing that it was providing escrow agent services to Mr Peh. It added that the statements of account Mr Peh received from Then were forgeries. Mr Peh claims that Then made fraudulent representations and should return his money. On Feb 21, Then and three others - one Swiss national and two British citizens - allegedly visited Mr Peh in Yio Chu Kang to threaten him, purportedly saying: ""You are easy to locate. Your family is in danger."" On March 15, the group allegedly visited Mr Peh again, telling him to cease legal action or risk harm to his family. The warning, said court documents, was delivered ""with the intent to cause death"". Then and his alleged Swiss accomplice were each charged with two counts of criminal intimidation last month. The case will be heard again in September. "

Chan, who is now 59, was found guilty of five counts of molestation last week by District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan after a trial. Seven other molestation charges involving four boys were taken into consideration for sentencing. The prosecution yesterday called for the court to sentence Chan to 50 months' jail, which includes an additional five months in lieu of caning, as he is above the age limit to be caned. ""The only reason the accused has escaped caning is that he absconded. He should not be given the benefit of this,"" Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew argued. In his mitigating plea, defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary urged the judge to be ""as lenient as possible"" as Chan had a ""sterling"" record up till 1999. Mr Tiwary said Chan had continued to contribute and help young teenagers, even when he was in Malaysia. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Shaiffudin said it was ""particularly egregious"" that Chan had abused the trust and authority vested in him by the school and the boys' parents. He added that there was also premeditation on Chan's part in carrying out the 12 offences involving nine boys who were 13 years old at the time, and that he had taken advantage of and exploited their vulnerability. In June 1999, Chan molested the Secondary 1 students during a three-day school camp at Guillemard Camp in Old Airport Road. In Nov 29 that year, he failed to turn up in court and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. His employment contract was later terminated by NUS after he failed to turn up for work. Chan reportedly had run a company called Procamps, which taught young people study skills and organised camps for children during the school holidays. During the trial that began last year, some of the victims testified in court that Chan had touched their genitals one night during the 1999 camp.

A police report was lodged and Chan was arrested on Nov 27, 1999. However, he later absconded and fled illegally to Malaysia while he was released on bail. It is not known how he was caught in Malaysia but he was finally sent back to Singapore on Dec 7, 2016. Yesterday, Judge Shaiffudin said he would have sentenced Chan to a total of 38 months' jail and 10 to 11 strokes of the cane. But as Chan is older than 50, he cannot be caned. Instead, the judge imposed an additional five months' jail in lieu of caning, bringing the jail term to a total of 43 months. Chan's lawyer, Mr Tiwary, indicated that his client plans to appeal against the conviction and asked for bail to be extended. DPP Chew, who had previously asked Judge Shaiffudin to revoke Chan's bail, did not oppose but requested that the court increase the bail amount by $30,000 to $90,000. DPP Chew also urged the court to require Chan to wear an electronic tag so that his whereabouts can be monitored, as well as to report to the investigation officer every week. These were accepted by the judge and Chan is currently out on bail. "

Chinese national Zheng Guiling, 40, and Lim Peng Boon, a 64-year-old Singaporean man, were convicted of offences under the Immigration Act. ICA said that in September 2014, Zheng, who had been on a 30-day visit pass, was introduced to Lim through a friend. Zheng then told Lim that she wanted to stay and work in Singapore, to which Lim suggested that he could help find a local husband who could enter into a marriage of convenience with her, and hence prolong her stay in the country. Lim told Zheng to pay $8,000 for the sham marriage arrangements, of which $6,000 would be given to her prospective husband. Later that same month, Lim introduced Zheng to Loh Chee Wai, a 54-year-old Singaporean man, who agreed to enter into a sham marriage. Zheng gave Lim $1,500 and paid the remaining $6,500 after the couple solemnised their marriage on Oct 22, 2014. Loh received $3,000 from Lim after the solemnisation, and was told by Lim that the remaining $3,000 would be paid by Zheng in instalments. Loh and Zheng were arrested by ICA officers on May 30, 2018, for entering into a marriage of convenience, said ICA. They were each sentenced to six months' jail, with Loh sentenced on Dec 14, 2018, and Zheng sentenced on July 17 this year. Lim was arrested on Jan 14 this year. On July 24, he was jailed for 11 months and fined $8,000, which in default is two months' jail. ICA said that it takes a serious view of individuals trying to circumvent its system by engaging in, arranging or assisting to arrange marriages of convenience to obtain immigration facilities in Singapore. If convicted, a person may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to 10 years, or both. ICA said it would continue to take firm enforcement action against errant couples or middlemen, and spare no effort in investigating such cases. Members of the public can report any suspected such cases to ICA at 1800-3916150. Any information provided would be treated in strictest confidence, it said. "

In the most serious incident, the 35-year-old punched a lorry driver in the face, head and stomach, leaving the victim with facial fractures that required surgery. On Monday (July 29), Fuad pleaded guilty to two counts of using criminal force, one count of voluntarily causing hurt, and one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Two other charges involving harassment will be taken into consideration during sentencing at a later date. On Aug 12, 2016, Fuad and the lorry driver, Mr Pek Lian Hui, were in a carpark at the National University of Singapore at about 8.20pm. Mr Pek, a 52-year-old contractor, was driving ahead of Fuad's car, looking for a vacant parking space. Fuad felt that Mr Pek was driving too slowly and sounded his horn. He then overtook Mr Pek's lorry, pointed his middle finger as he passed the vehicle, and stopped his car in front of the lorry. When Mr Pek alighted from his lorry and approached Fuad, a heated dispute ensued. Fuad then punched Mr Pek several times in the face, head and stomach. He only stopped the assault after his mother and a passer-by intervened. Deputy Public Prosecutor Bjorn Tan said the incident left Mr Pek bleeding heavily from his injuries. A medical report later showed that Mr Pek had suffered fractures on his face, and multiple facial abrasions as well as swelling and tenderness. Four days after the assault, Mr Pek received surgery to fix the broken bones. This voluntarily causing grievous hurt charge carries a jail term of up to 10 years, as well as a fine or caning. While Fuad was on bail, he got involved in a second road rage incident. On Dec 2, 2017, Fuad, who was working as a private-hire driver, side-swiped a taxi which was driving towards a pick-up point in Clarke Quay, along River Valley Road. The taxi driver, Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed Shariff, 46, had been queueing to pick his passenger up from the taxi stand when a road marshal directed him to move his taxi to a pick-up point meant for private cars. As the taxi was moving off, Fuad drove up from behind Mr Iqbal and the left side mirror of his car hit the taxi's right-side mirror. When both drivers alighted from their vehicles, an argument broke out and Fuad pointed his middle finger at Mr Iqbal and pushed his left cheek, causing him to lose his balance. Mr Iqbal suffered bruising on his face and was given three days of medical leave. In the third road rage incident which occurred in February this year while he was still on bail, Fuad punched taxi driver Tio Seng Sing, 71, in the face after cutting in front of the older man's taxi. Mr Tio had to hit his brakes hard to avoid an accident. The incident happened in Selegie Road towards Bukit Timah Road. In May last year, Fuad also got into an argument with a man who had accidentally bumped into him while walking in the opposite direction at VivoCity. He behaved aggressively towards the man by pushing his shoulder, face and left elbow. DPP Tan urged the court to sentence Fuad to 18 months and six weeks' jail. In his mitigation plea, Fuad's counsel said his client has been seeking help for anger management issues since last year, but added that ""these things take some time"". Fuad is expected to be sentenced on Sept 4. "

On Monday, the prosecution called for the court to sentence Chan to 50 months' jail, which included an additional five months in lieu of caning, as he is above the age limit to be caned. ""The only reason why the accused has escaped caning is that he absconded. He should not be given the benefit of this,"" Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew argued. In his mitigating plea, defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary urged the judge to be ""as lenient as possible"" as Chan had a ""sterling"" record up till 1999. Mr Tiwary added that Chan had also continued to contribute and help young teenagers, even when he was in Malaysia. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Shaiffudin said that it was ""particularly egregious"" that Chan had abused the trust and authority vested in him by the school and the boys' parents. He added that there was also premeditation on Chan's part in carrying out the 12 offences involving nine boys who were 13 years old at the time, and that he had taken advantage of and exploited their vulnerability. In June 1999, Chan molested the Secondary 1 students during a three-day school camp at the Guillemard Camp in Old Airport Road. In Nov 29 that year, he failed to turn up in court and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. His employment contract was later terminated by NUS after he failed to turn up for work. Chan reportedly had run a company called Procamps, which taught young people study skills and organised camps for children during school holidays. During the trial that began last year, some of the victims testified in court that Chan had touched their genitals one night during the 1999 trip. A Secondary 2 student leader also said that he witnessed Chan touching one of the students' private parts, and alerted a teacher the next day.

The police revealed this figure on Sunday (July 28) in a fresh advisory against such scams, ahead of several events and concerts planned in the next few months. It said that in the cases reported from January to May, the victims either did not receive their tickets or got invalid tickets after making payment. The advisory comes as Singapore gets ready for its 54th National Day Parade on Aug 9, followed by the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix 2019 from Sept 20 to Sept 22. Popular international acts such as Westlife, Shawn Mendes, U2 and Backstreet Boys are also due to play here this year. In the advisory, the police reminded members of the public to take crime prevention measures to avoid being scammedwhile purchasing tickets for these events. - Be wary of online advertisements selling concert or show tickets at cheap prices that sound too good to be true, and avoid buying them on impulse without reading the reviews of the seller. - Do not fall for scammers who may also use a local bank account or provide a copy of a NRIC or driver's licence to give the impression that they are genuine. - Avoid making payments or deposits in advance. Instead, use shopping platforms or arrangements that release the payment to the seller only upon receiving the item. Alternatively, arrange to meet the seller and pay only after collecting the tickets. There could also be a possibility that the tickets may not be valid for entry as they were duplicated. It is advisable to buy them only from authorised sellers.

The scammers would use e-mails with the template ""procurement @ _edu-sg.com"". A purchase order would be sent to the company via e-mail once the agreement is made. Fooled into believing that a genuine e-mail was sent, the company would deliver the goods to the stated address. Investigations have revealed that the address indicated usually belonged to freight-forwarding companies engaged by scammers to ship the goods overseas. No payments were eventually received. Companies are advised to verify the sender's domain name and authenticity of the request by contacting the universities via their official contact numbers, instead of those provided in the e-mail, the police advised.

The boy turned out to be 13 years old. Aslam also admitted to making an obscene film of their sex act when they met a second time. The former horse racing jockey with the Singapore Turf Club was yesterday jailed for 18 months for engaging in a sexual act with a person under the age of 14. The court heard that some time in mid-January last year, Aslam sent the victim a message via the app requesting sex. After an exchange of messages discussing the price for the act, it was agreed that Aslam would pay the boy, who cannot be named due to a gag order, $130. The boy's father reported the matter to the police in February last year, when he learnt that his son had engaged in sexual activities. Court documents showed that before they met, Aslam had asked the victim for his age and the latter claimed he was 17. This was the only time he asked the boy his age. On Jan 30 last year, they met for the first time when the victim went to Aslam's home. The boy had a small stature and youthful look, but Aslam made no attempt to verify his age. They undressed and sniffed ""poppers"", which is an illicit psychoactive drug used to relax the muscles, and Aslam had sex with the boy while wearing a condom. They met about a week later at Aslam's home where he again had sex with the boy. This time, Aslam used his mobile phone to film the act. The boy did not know he was caught on video. In his mitigation, Aslam's lawyer Nichol Yeo said his client had believed that the victim was at least 17 years old. Mr Yeo added that the app has age verification safeguards in place, where users have to verify and confirm that they are above 18 years old when registering for an account. The victim had indicated on his profile in the app that he was 18. He said Aslam also tried to verify the victim's age by asking him how old he was, and the victim replied that he was 17. ""This was the second time the victim misrepresented his age and my client had no reason to suspect he was under 16 or even under 14,"" said Mr Yeo, asking the court for a global sentence of 12 months' jail for his client. Mr Yeo also told the court that the victim initiated the second meeting and told Aslam that he needed money again, giving him a discount of $30 from the initial price. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Lim asked for a global sentence of 18 months as a general deterrence against such crimes involving children who were vulnerable to sexual exploitation. For engaging in a sexual act with a person under the age of 14, Aslam could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned. "

Seah and Sergeant Durganivashini Yogendran arrived at about 10.30am, and Seah asked to take a look at Mr Zeng's walking stick. The older man handed it to him. Deputy Public Prosecutor Deborah Lee said during the trial: ""The accused then knocked the walking stick several times on the floor... before stepping hard on the stick with his right foot, causing it to become bent and diminish in utility.""

The 53-year-old, who cannot be named due to a gag order, had earlier pleaded guilty to two charges under the Infectious Diseases Act for failing to disclose that he was HIV-positive to the women. The court heard that the women, both Chinese nationals who rented a one-bedroom apartment from the man, would not have engaged in sexual activities with him had they known about his condition. Both women did not contract HIV. A third woman also living in the apartment did not have sex with him. The man, who was working as a security officer at the time and was described in court documents as a former police officer, also admitted to one count each of knowingly living off the earnings of prostitution and allowing his rented apartment to be used as a brothel. Court documents did not reveal when or why the man left the Singapore Police Force. The man first suspected that he had contracted HIV in Thailand in 2003, but did not seek treatment until he was formally diagnosed five years later. On Jan 14, 2017, he signed a tenancy agreement for the apartment in Geylang and later informed members of a group on messaging app WeChat that the unit was for rent at $80 per day. Most members of the group were sex workers, the court heard. Subsequently, he wittingly allowed three Chinese nationals, between 33 and 39 years old, to provide sexual services in the apartment between June 22 and July 11 that year. He advised the trio to be careful about their clients so that they would not get caught by undercover police officers. For reasons not explained in court documents, the Singaporean man sent an e-mail to the Ministry of Health on April 4, 2017, stating that he had sex with a prostitute whom he suspected of having a sexually transmitted disease. He wanted the authorities to investigate and repatriate her. He then sent another e-mail four days later, revealing he was HIV-positive. He said he was having sex with the woman when his condom broke. HIV infection can lead to Aids, a potentially fatal condition. The information was referred to the ministry's Surveillance and Enforcement Branch for further investigation. By then it emerged that the man already had sex on multiple occasions with the two women, from January to June 2017. He knew them prior to their move to the apartment. The court heard that on one occasion in June 2017, the man wanted to engage the sexual services of one of the women. But when she was not willing to have sex with him, he told her he was a police officer and would cause trouble for her. She perceived this to mean that he would cause her to be deported and agreed to have intercourse with him. He did not pay her for her services. On Friday, the man's lawyer Chu Hua Yi asked the court to consider his client's circumstances. The man's father was suffering from stage four prostate cancer and stage two stomach cancer. The man is also the sole caregiver and breadwinner for his son who has cerebral palsy and mobility issues, said Mr Chu. In his submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Ong said among the aggregating factors of the case, the man had misrepresented himself as a police officer to procure sexual services and had also knowingly allowed the unit to be used as a brothel. For failing to disclose that he was HIV-positive before having sex with the women, the man could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined $50,000. "

The man claimed that he was being extorted by three men after he accidentally bumped into one of them. He said he was made to send serial codes of Alipay credits worth $9,200 to a specified e-mail address as compensation for the injuries he had caused, the police said on Wednesday. Suspicious of the inconsistencies in the man's account, the police probed further and learnt that he was actually the victim of a credit-for-sex scam. It is believed that he received an unsolicited offer of sexual services from a woman on an online dating app and was told to deposit at least $9,200 worth of Alipay credits to book her services.

A district court heard yesterday that Joney Song Siang Siang had been entrusted with seven cheques from the Central Provident Fund Board under the Silver Support Scheme, which provides retirement assistance for people who have had low incomes throughout their lives. According to court documents relating to the latest charge, she allegedly encashed the cheques in July 2017 and kept the money, which amounted to $4,200. She told the court yesterday that she will plead guilty to this charge and intends to make full restitution to the seven alleged victims. Prior to this, Song, 38, who worked at the Grace Lodge nursing home in Compassvale Walk from June 1 to Aug 11, 2017, pleaded guilty on May 31 to two criminal breach of trust charges. Her two victims, Mr Ho Park Tong, 77, and Mr Han Lee Fong, 80, were under her care when she persuaded them to activate their ATM cards. Song accompanied the pair during the activation process and noted down their personal identification numbers. She went to several ATMs around Singapore in July that year to withdraw cash and make transfers from the victims' bank accounts. The court heard that from July 3 to 17, 2017, Song misappropriated nearly $40,700 from Mr Ho's account. She also accessed Mr Han's account from July 27 to 29 that year to perform 23 transfers and withdrawals totalling nearly $7,000. Song then threw away the cards after committing the offences and resigned from her job. Her offences came to light in January last year when her replacement checked the two victims' bank statements and spotted suspicious transactions. The police were alerted on Jan 25 last year, the court heard. To date, Song has paid $45,000 in restitution. She is now out on bail of $15,000 and will be back in court on Aug 27.

Madam Liang Yuan-chia, 45, was taken to Singapore General Hospital and was found to have a minor head injury and strained buttocks. She was later given two days of outpatient medical leave. District Judge Mathew Joseph yesterday found the Singaporean e-scooter rider, Toh Zhiwei, 35, guilty of riding a device in a rash manner, causing hurt to the tourist when it hit her. Madam Liang had been looking at her mobile phone when she walked out of the MRT station with her husband and daughter around 3.50pm on Jan 26 last year. The court heard that the ground was wet as it was raining. She was walking slowly while still looking at the phone when Toh's e-scooter hit her from behind. She fell after it hit her right heel, the court heard. According to Toh, he was then travelling at between 13 and 15kmh. He stopped to help Madam Liang and also called for an ambulance. Police arrested Toh later that day. In her submissions, Assistant Public Prosecutor Lim Yu Hui stated that due to the wet floor and the number of people in the area that day, Toh should have dismounted and pushed his e-scooter. The APP added: ""Instead, he decided to ride the e-scooter even though he was fully aware of the risk of collision. He even increased his speed just before the collision even though there was a blind spot. ""This resulted in him being unable to stop the e-scooter when he saw the victim. He jumped off and tried to swerve the e-scooter in his bid to avoid the victim, but he was unable to do so in time.""

However, closed-circuit television footage of the incident did not capture him doing so, the court heard. When queried, he claimed it was difficult to see him slowing down due to the angle from which the clip was recorded. The APP said this explanation was illogical, adding: ""If he had indeed slowed down... there is no reason why this was not captured by the footage. The only reason is that he simply did not do so."" Toh's case has been adjourned to Aug 6. For causing hurt by performing a rash act, he can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. "

Madam Liang Yuan-Chia, 45, was taken to Singapore General Hospital and was found to have a minor head injury and strained buttocks. She was later given two days of outpatient medical leave. District Judge Mathew Joseph on Wednesday (July 24) found the Singaporean e-scooter rider, Toh Zhiwei, 35, guilty of riding a device in a rash manner, causing hurt to the tourist when it hit her. Madam Liang had been looking at her mobile phone when she walked out of the MRT station with her husband and daughter around 3.50pm on Jan 26 last year. The court heard that the ground was wet as it was raining. She was walking slowly while still looking at the phone when Toh's e-scooter approached her from behind. She fell after it hit her right heel, the court heard. According to Toh, he was then travelling at between 13kmh and 15kmh. He stopped to help Madam Liang and also called for an ambulance. Police received information about the incident from the Singapore Civil Defence Force soon after and officers arrested Toh later that day. In her submissions, Assistant Public Prosecutor Lim Yu Hui stated that due to the wet floor and the number of people in the area that day, Toh should have dismounted and pushed his e-scooter. The APP added: ""Instead, he decided to ride the e-scooter even though he was fully aware of the risk of collision. He even increased his speed just before the collision even though there was a blind spot. ""This resulted in him being unable to stop the e-scooter when he saw the victim. He jumped off and tried to swerve the e-scooter in his bid to avoid the victim but he was unable to do so in time."" During the trial, Toh, who is represented by lawyer Peter Ong, testified that he had slowed down before the collision. However, closed-circuit television footage of the incident did not capture him doing so, the court heard. When queried, he claimed that it was difficult to see him slowing down due to the angle from which the clip was recorded. The APP said this explanation was ""illogical"", adding: ""If he had indeed slowed down... there is no reason why this was not captured by the footage. The only reason is that he simply did not do so."" Toh's case has been adjourned to Aug 6. For causing hurt by performing a rash act, he can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. "

Elankovan Marimuthu got more than he bargained for when a motorist alerted the police after spotting the toy at around 2pm on Nov 3, 2017, sparking an operation that involved 39 officers from various units. Eight Singapore Armed Forces officers from the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group were also deployed to the park near Orchard Road. The nearby Penang Lane was partly cordoned off to traffic for 45 minutes and fully closed for half an hour as the officers had to ascertain whether the grenade-like object was a threat to public safety. Penang Lane was finally reopened at around 5pm after they confirmed it was only a toy. Elankovan, 59, pleaded guilty on Wednesday (July 24) to using threatening behaviour to cause alarm and was fined $4,500. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran said the cleaner was working at Istana Park at around 7am on Nov 3, 2017, when he spotted the toy grenade near a fire hydrant in Penang Lane. It was not stated how the object ended up there. The DPP told the court that Elankovan used a pair of tongs to position the item in an upright manner. He said: ""The accused decided to position the item in such a manner because he wanted to see how the public would react to the item once it was discovered. The accused subsequently left the scene."" Two motorists at the junction of Penang Lane and Orchard Road spotted the toy at around 2pm that day. One of them then called the police, leading to the operation. The court heard that Elankovan was caught after the authorities viewed closed-circuit television footage of the area, which showed him handling the toy.

The video clip shown in court yesterday was taken from a police officer's body-worn camera when the police questioned the duo. In it, Muhammad Nur Fatwa Mahmood, a staff sergeant, and Mohamed Farid Mohd Saleh, a first warrant officer, are seen disagreeing on whether the latter had given the instruction for the push. On the night of May 13 last year, a group of SCDF servicemen was celebrating Cpl Kok's impending operationally-ready date at Tuas View Fire Station. Following a cake-cutting ceremony for Cpl Kok, 22, some officers carried him to the 12m-deep fire station pump well, where he later drowned after Nur Fatwa pushed him in. Last October, Nur Fatwa was sentenced to one year and four weeks in jail for pushing Cpl Kok and telling another officer to delete footage of the incident. Nur Fatwa, 34, who completed his sentence earlier this month, took the stand yesterday during the trial of Farid, the officer who has been accused of instigating the push. Farid, 35, is contesting the charge of abetting a rash act causing death. In the video footage , a police officer asks Farid if he is the one who gave the instruction to push Cpl Kok into the pump well. ""I didn't literally, like, ask him to... I just say 'so slow ah?', that's it,"" said an individual identified as Farid in the recording. Another man identified as Nur Fatwa can be heard saying in Malay, ""you said to push him in la, Rid,"" using Farid's nickname ""Rid"" to address him. Farid replies in Malay he had asked Cpl Kok to ""sit there"". A while later, Nur Fatwa says in Malay: ""Just now you already said, push him in, correct or not, don't play me out Farid."" Addressing the exchange in the video, Nur Fatwa, whom fellow officers call ""Wa"" for short, said he had said this as he felt betrayed that Farid did not want to admit that he had given the instruction. Earlier, in a separate video showing the group gathered at the pump well before Cpl Kok was pushed in, Nur Fatwa also pointed out the moment that he remembered Farid saying ""Wa, tolak dia"", meaning ""Wa, push him"" in Malay. Recounting the events in the immediate aftermath of the May 13 incident, Nur Fatwa said he had told the group of officers involved that they should be responsible for what they did together. However he said everyone responded with silence. Earlier in the day, another witness, Staff Sergeant Al-Khudaifi Chang, 26, agreed during cross-examination by Farid's defence lawyer Chhabra Vinit that it was possible Nur Fatwa had said this to the group because he did not want to shoulder the responsibility of the incident alone. SSgt Chang had also said Nur Fatwa had gone around asking other officers if they had heard Farid giving him the instruction to push Cpl Kok into the well, but none of them did. When asked why he had done so, Nur Fatwa said: ""In a way, I wanted to get assurance from other people on whether they heard Farid say this."" The trial continues today when Nur Fatwa will undergo cross-examination. "

Court documents said Farid did not see who did this or how it happened, and he remained in the control room to have a second helping of cake and talk to rota commander Kenneth Chong Chee Boon. As a result, Farid did not hear the protests that Cpl Kok had made while he was carried to the well, and he only joined the group around the pump well when Cpl Kok was back on the ground.

After a trial, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan yesterday found Chan Cheng, now 59, guilty of five counts of molestation. Seven other molestation charges involving four other boys are still pending. The teenagers were in Secondary 1 when Chan molested them at the Guillemard Camp in Old Airport Road during a three-day school camp in June 1999. Chan failed to turn up in court on Nov 29 that year, and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. The former president of the Singapore Psychological Society later had his contract terminated by NUS after he failed to turn up for work. Chan was reported to have had his own company known as Procamps to teach study skills to youngsters. He also organised camps for children during school holidays. During the trial, a man who had been on the 1999 trip told the court how he had been sitting on a bed chatting with a friend when Chan started massaging his thigh. The man told the court that he pushed Chan's hand away when it moved to his private parts. The victim's friend, who also testified, said he was shocked at what he had witnessed. Three other former campers also told the court during the trial that Chan had touched their genitals that night. The fifth victim said that Chan had targeted him on the second day of the camp by applying powder onto his private parts before molesting him. A Secondary 2 student leader saw Chan touching one of the teenagers' private parts when he entered a boys' bunk on the second night. Unsure of what to do, the student leader asked Chan about a debriefing session and left before alerting a teacher the next day. The teacher interviewed one of the victims who revealed that Chan had also targeted his other schoolmates. The teacher then told the school principal, who lodged a police report. Officers arrested Chan on Nov 27, 1999. He was released on bail and was supposed to turn up in court two days later, when he absconded and fled to Malaysia. Chan, who obtained his PhD from Oxford University, was last seen at NUS on Nov 23, 1999. It was not stated how he was caught in Malaysia, but he was finally sent back to Singapore on Dec 7, 2016. Chan is now out on bail of $60,000 and is due back in court next Monday. "

Muhammad Lutfi Dzakir Abdul Rahman, 18, pleaded guilty on Monday (July 22) to causing hurt to the toddler while riding his e-scooter in a rash manner. The girl cannot be named because of  her age. On Aug 10, 2017, she was at Eastpoint Mall in Simei Street 6 with her older brother and their domestic helper. They left the shopping centre at around 1pm and the two children ran towards the bus stop. Lutfi was riding his e-scooter towards the bus stop at around the same time, the court heard. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng told District Judge May Mesenas: ""The accused failed to slow down despite noticing that there was a crowd of pedestrians and commuters present waiting for the bus. ""The accused... proceeded to ride his e-scooter at a speed of about 17 (to) 19kmh... a speed which was unsafe in the circumstances."" Lutfi was approaching the end of the bus stop when the toddler stepped in front of him. He tried to stop his e-scooter but it hit the little girl, who fell to the ground. He went forward to help her and gave his particulars to the children's domestic helper. The girl was taken to Changi General Hospital (CGH) where she was found to have a mild abrasion on her right knee and a minor head injury. Lutfi also went to CGH to meet the children's mother and offered to pay for the little girl's medical expenses. The court heard that the girl was discharged later that day and the mother made a police report at around 6pm. Judge Mesenas called for a report to assess Lutfi's suitability for a probation and he was offered bail of $5,000. The accused is expected to be sentenced on Aug 19. For hurting the toddler by riding his e-scooter in a rash manner, he can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. "

Seven other molestation charges involving four boys are still pending. The teenagers were in Secondary 1 when Chan molested them at the Guillemard Camp in Old Airport Road during a three-day school camp in June 1999. Chan failed to turn up in court on Nov 29 that year and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. The former president of the Singapore Psychological Society later had his contract terminated by NUS after he failed to turn up for work. Chan was reported to have had his own company, known as Procamps, to teach study skills to youngsters. He also organised camps for children during school holidays. During the trial, a man who had been on the 1999 trip told the court how he had been sitting on a bed chatting with a friend when Chan started massaging his thigh. The man told the court that he pushed Chan’s hand away when it moved to his private parts. The victim’s friend, who also testified, said he was “shocked” at what he witnessed. Three other former campers also told the court during the trial that Chan had touched their genitals that night. The fifth victim said that Chan had targeted him on the second day of the camp by applying powder onto his private parts before molesting him. A Secondary 2 student leader entered a boys’ bunk on the second night when he saw Chan touching one of the teenagers’ private parts. Unsure of what to do, the student leader asked Chan about a debriefing session and left before alerting a teacher the next day. The teacher interviewed one of the victims who revealed that Chan had also targeted his other schoolmates. The teacher then told the school principal who lodged a police report. Officers arrested Chan on Nov 27, 1999.  He was released on bail and was supposed to turn up in court two days later when he absconded and fled illegally to Malaysia.  Chan, who obtained his PhD from Oxford University, was last seen at NUS on Nov 23, 1999.  It was not stated how he was caught in Malaysia but he was finally sent back to Singapore on Dec 7, 2016. Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew said that Chan “appears to be contending that the victims had framed him because of their unhappiness with the harsh, regimental style of the camp, and in particular, because he had conducted a harsh, punishment session on all the campers on the first night”. The DPP added that this contention was “baseless, far-fetched, and has no merit whatsoever”. On Monday, DPP Chew said that the former lecturer has a history of absconding and urged Judge Shaiffudin to revoke his bail. The DPP added: ""The presumption of innocence no longer applies."" Defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary pleaded for his client to be given bail, saying that Chan had been turning up in court ""punctually every single time"" for the last two years. Judge Shaiffudin allowed Chan to be released on bail, with an added condition that the former lecturer must report to the investigation officer every day. Chan is now out on bail of $60,000 and is due back in court on July 29. For each count of molestation, offenders can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. Chan cannot be caned as he is over 50. "

""That's not how they work,"" said Mr Chan, 72. The Police Gallantry Medal winner, who traded gunfire with criminals in the 1970s, said assassins had existed in the ""cowboy"" days. He recalled investigating a case in the early 1970s when a hitman was employed to deal with an illegal 4-D operator who had refused to pay the full $60,000 prize to a winner. The gunman, hired by the winner through his contacts, visited the 4-D operator at his village home in Jalan Lam Sam to warn him to pay up. ""The table talk was unsuccessful,"" said Mr Chan. ""The 4-D operator later taunted the winner by saying he should have sent somebody with more 'weight' to come to his home,"" he added. Angered, the gunman returned and fired his Smith and Wesson revolver - but all five rounds missed their target who escaped into a nearby plantation. Several months later, the gunman was cornered in Pasir Panjang where he was killed after a shootout with police, Mr Chan said. In 2009, Singaporean Diana Goh Li Fun hired assassins to deal with Canadian property developer Francis Alex Degioanni, who had apparently owed her several million Thai baht in personal loans. This time, the assassins' bullets did not miss their mark. Mr Degioanni was killed in his black pick-up outside his Patong Beach condominium in Phuket after two hitmen on a motorcycle had ambushed him. The perpetrators were later arrested, including Goh, who is serving a life sentence in Thailand. "

Director of Averex Law Corporation Ian Chang Yen Ping, 49, pleaded guilty in court to one count of mischief. The court heard that he was driving his car into the condominium basement on July 31 last year when he noticed that Mr Ye Yuzhi's vehicle was not properly parked in its space. Defence lawyer Lee Teck Leng said that Chang felt Mr Ye, 29, was very inconsiderate and scratched the door on the driver's side of the man's car, causing $3,350 in damage. Chang was nabbed after Mr Ye viewed footage from his car's in-vehicle camera, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Teh. It showed Chang walking in front of the vehicle with three distinct scratching sounds heard soon after. The lawyer then left the scene. Mr Ye alerted the police on Aug 1 last year, and Chang later admitted to officers that he had scratched the car with a key. Pleading for a maximum fine of $2,000, Mr Lee told District Judge Ong Hian Sun yesterday that his client's mental state at the time had been affected by unfortunate events in his life, including his mother-in-law's terminal thyroid cancer. A report from the Institute of Mental Health dated April 22 this year stated that Chang was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Mr Lee told Judge Ong that his client had made full compensation. Mr Lee also said that his client had acted on impulse and his behaviour showed a lack of self-control. ""His depressive state with anxious distress would have contributed to his impassivity, lack of self-control and failure to appreciate the gravity of his action,"" Mr Lee added. The court heard that Chang's mother-in-law died on Feb 21. In a statement yesterday, the Law Society said that it is not privy to information on the particulars of the charges against Chang. Its spokesman added: ""Once the court proceeding is concluded, the Law Society will review the facts of the matter to determine if disciplinary action is necessary.""

Mr Ng Kong Yeam told Madam Kay this would spare her from going through a probate process, which could lead to ugly fights over his estate, and was more practical for keeping the business going in the event of his death, she said. ""The shares, all along he wanted to give to me, because all the company owned was our home and the business we built up,"" she told the High Court yesterday. Madam Kay, 66, was on the stand for over two days in the ongoing suit filed against her and her daughter by Mr Ng's wife and children. The case is brought on behalf of Mr Ng, 80, who now has dementia. He moved back with his wife in Johor Baru in 2013 on Madam Kay's suggestion, the court heard. The Ngs, who are Malaysians, are seeking the return of 799,999 Natwest Holdings shares that they allege had been fraudulently transferred to Madam Kay in 2010. The transfer made Madam Kay, who originally held one share, the sole shareholder of Natwest, valued at about $20 million at the time. Natwest owns SA Tours and a $4 million Cairnhill apartment, which has been home for Mr Ng's Singapore family from 1995. Madam Kay testified that it had always been Mr Ng's intention to have SA Tours and the apartment, his two main assets in Singapore, transferred to her and her daughter to provide for them. The transfer form, dated Nov 1, 2010, was lodged with the company secretary on April 1, 2011. As to why the form stated she paid $1 million for the shares, Madam Kay said she and Mr Ng agreed on it as a ""nice round figure"". It took into account the money she had lent Mr Ng over the years when he was facing financial difficulties and the fact that she had paid for ""everything"" in the household, she added. Madam Kay said Mr Ng told her to lodge the form after he gave the go-ahead. She said he told her that he needed some time to ensure that Natwest's assets were ""unencumbered"", a term used to describe a property without a mortgage or loans secured against it. Senior Counsel Roderick Martin, acting for the Ng family, put it to her that this conversation did not take place. There were mortgages on the apartment and several units at People's Park Complex owned by SA Tours in the time between the form was signed and lodged, he noted. This did not square with what Mr Ng said about making sure the assets were unencumbered. Questioned by her own lawyer Clement Ong, Madam Kay said the properties were mortgaged to get banking facilities for SA Tours, and by unencumbered, she meant that Mr Ng wanted to make sure there was no money owing to the banks. Mr Martin also noted she transferred all the 27 million shares that Natwest held in SA Tours to her son-in-law Jared Liew last year. Asked if she knew she may not get her shares back if he were to split from her daughter, Madam Kay said they have an understanding she was the beneficial owner. Mr Martin also questioned why Mr Ng would give her the shares, pointing to two separate e-mails in 2008 and 2010 in which Madam Kay complained about his womanising and sex addiction, and about being treated like a toy. These were only two e-mails of her venting against the backdrop of a 30-year relationship, she said, adding that they always worked things out as there was love.

Myanmar national Ye Lin Myint, 36, was sentenced to two years and five months' jail in January. He had pleaded guilty to five counts of criminal intimidation and eight harassment charges, while 30 other charges for similar offences were taken into consideration during sentencing. On Friday, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon dismissed his appeal, saying the jail sentence was ""not manifestly excessive"" and ""if anything, it was on the low side"". Some time in mid-2017, Ye Lin Myint, a Singapore permanent resident who was an agent with Prudential at the time, felt disrespected when his clients cancelled their policies with him and prospective clients did not turn up for their scheduled appointments. Angered by their actions, he sent them e-mails and letters with the pseudonym ""Lord Voldermort"" - a misspelling of the name of boy wizard Harry Potter's nemesis - between August and September in 2017. He threatened to harm them if they did not send him one bitcoin, which was worth about $6,600 at the time. When they did not accede to his demands, he decided to target their neighbours instead. In his letters to the neighbours of his clients, whom he did not know, he threatened to harass their units if they did not get his clients to pay him what he wanted. His actions eventually led the Singapore Police Force and Nee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah to issue online advisories, in which victims are advised not to respond to the letters. In his judgment remarks on Friday, the Chief Justice said Ye Lin Myint had acted maliciously and misused confidential information relating to his clients in threatening an escalating cycle of harm if they did not comply with his demands. The former insurance agent had also falsely represented his clients as being indebted to him in his letters to their neighbours. Chief Justice Menon also noted that Ye Lin Myint's actions had caused a high degree of public alarm given the ""sheer number of victims"" he targeted. While he acknowledged that Ye Lin Myint had been depressed at the time, the Chief Justice noted that the psychiatric evidence showed it was a ""mild episode of depression with no significant contributory link to the offence"". By sending the letters anonymously, it showed that he had intended to prey on his victims' fear, said the Chief Justice.

Director of Averex Law Corporation Ian Chang Yen Ping, 49, pleaded guilty in court to one count of mischief. The court heard that he was driving his car into the condominium basement on July 31 last year when he noticed that Mr Ye Yuzhi's vehicle was not properly parked in its lot. Defence lawyer Lee Teck Leng said that Chang felt Mr Ye, 29, was ""very inconsiderate"" and scratched the door on the driver's side of the man's car, causing $3,350 in damage. Chang was nabbed after Mr Ye viewed footage from his car's in-vehicle camera, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Teh. It showed Chang walking in front of the vehicle with three distinct scratching sounds heard soon after. The lawyer then left the scene. Mr Ye alerted the police on Aug 1 last year and Chang later admitted to officers that he had scratched the car with a key. Pleading for a maximum fine of $2,000, Mr Lee told District Judge Ong Hian Sun on Friday that his client's mental state at the time had been affected by unfortunate events in his life - including his mother-in-law's terminal thyroid cancer. A report from the Institute of Mental Health dated April 22 this year stated that Chang was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Mr Lee told Judge Ong that his client had made full compensation. Mr Lee also said that his client had acted on impulse and his behaviour showed a lack of self-control. ""His depressive state with anxious distress would have contributed to his impassivity, lack of self control and failure to appreciate the gravity of his action,"" Mr Lee added. The court heard that Chang's mother-in-law died on Feb 21. In a statement on Friday, the Law Society said that it is not privy to information of the particulars of the charges against Chang. Its spokesman added: ""Once the court proceeding is concluded, the Law Society will review the facts of the matter to determine if disciplinary action is necessary."" For committing mischief, Chang could have been jailed for up to a year and fined. "

The attacker, Mr Ang Peng Hong, 62, later died of bleeding in the brain but a district court heard on Friday (July 19) that this was not related to the fall and was due to a disease. Lim Kian Seng, also 62, who had pushed him, pleaded guilty to causing hurt to Mr Ang by performing a negligent act and was fined the maximum $2,500. The two Singaporean men were both delivery drivers working for Dawn Shipping and Transport. Lim, who drove a pick-up truck, was based at Jurong Port and his duties included loading imported consignments onto the firm's delivery lorries. At around 9am on Sept 22 last year, he made arrangements with Mr Ang to load some imported goods for delivery in Singapore. These were loaded onto Mr Ang's lorry about an hour later and the men drove their respective vehicles to the customs clearance area near the exit of the port. At around 11.30am, a Customs officer told Mr Ang to return to Jurong Port to get the goods scanned for clearance. As a result, he had to drive out of the area, make a U-turn and stop just before the entrance into Jurong Port to wait for Lim. Lim stopped his pick-up truck behind Mr Ang's lorry soon after and asked his colleague why he had made the U-turn. The two men then started quarrelling, which escalated when Mr Ang raised his fists and challenged Lim to a fight. Deputy Public Prosecutor Asoka Markandu said Mr Ang moved towards Lim and started throwing punches at him. Lim raised his arms to fend off the blows and forcefully shoved his attacker's hands away. As a result, Mr Ang fell backwards and lost consciousness when his head hit the ground. He came to soon after and the two men walked back to their vehicles. However, one of their colleagues, who had entered Mr Ang's lorry, noticed that he was bleeding from his nose and alerted Lim. Lim then arranged for a replacement driver for Mr Ang, who was feeling dizzy, and drove him to the National University Hospital. Mr Ang was admitted that day and a CT scan revealed that he had a fractured skull. He died on Oct 19 last year. His autopsy report stated that he died from an ""acute intracerebral haemorrhage"". Pressing for a fine of $2,500, DPP Asoka told District Judge Kan Shuk Weng that Mr Ang was the aggressor in this case. Defence lawyer Yeo Ying Hao, who pleaded for a $2,000 fine, said his client is the family's sole breadwinner and would most likely lose his job due to this case. The lawyer added that Lim had acted out of character and committed the offence on the spur of the moment. For causing hurt by performing a negligent act, he could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $2,500. "

Judicial Commissioner Audrey Lim convicted Khoo of murdering engineer Cui Yajie, 31, on July 12, 2016, and rejected all defences he had raised to the charge. She said Khoo knew that pressing Ms Cui's neck with great force would ""likely cause her death"", and dismissed his claim that he had not intended to strangle her and only realised his hands were around her neck after she had stopped moving. She also rejected his testimony that Ms Cui had physically abused him, pointing to her smaller size in dismissing Khoo's claim that she had restrained him when he had tried to get out of the car. ""The accused acted in a cruel and unusual manner,"" said the judge, as Khoo listened calmly to the verdict. The judge also discredited Khoo's claim that he had burned Ms Cui's body to let her ""rest in peace"". She said Khoo had reason to kill Ms Cui, who was pressing him to repay a $20,000 debt to her, to avoid the financial pressure and threat of ruin that she posed. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" delta=""1"" element=""1"" fid=""777545"" height=""1024"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2019/07/18/ak_cy_1807_0.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" width=""1536""/><br/><figcaption>Ms Cui Yajie, whose body was burned by Leslie Khoo Kwee Hock after he killed her. PHOTO: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE</figcaption><br/></figure> Sentencing was adjourned to a later date. Khoo faces the death sentence or life imprisonment. Khoo did not dispute that he had strangled Ms Cui in his BMW and later burned her body at Lim Chu Kang Lane 8 over several days, until nothing was left except clumps of hair, pieces of partly burnt fabric and a bra hook. But his defence argued he should be found guilty only of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Khoo's lawyer Mervyn Cheong said the fight in the car was sudden, and he had been provoked by her verbal taunts. The defence claimed he was suffering from a mental condition known as intermittent explosive disorder. The prosecution, led by Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair, said Khoo was bent on silencing Ms Cui after she had threatened to expose him to his supervisor. Khoo, who is married with a son, was a retail outlet manager for a laundry firm, while Ms Cui, a Chinese national, was a senior engineer at a semiconductor company. They met in early 2015 when Khoo had helped her out of a sticky situation with a former boyfriend. They began a relationship but Khoo told her untruths, such as that the laundry company belonged to his family and that he was single. When she later became suspicious, he told her he was divorced. He also persuaded her to invest $20,000 in gold, which she borrowed from her parents to give him. The lovers had frequent quarrels over Khoo spending too much time with his ""ex-wife"" and son, and the money, which he had secretly used for another purpose. In July 2016, Khoo asked a former lover to remit $10,000 to Ms Cui's father, but the couple had a heated quarrel when she discovered it was only half the sum. Meanwhile, Khoo's wife confronted him for cheating on her, after Ms Cui sent her a Facebook message to stay away from him. In the early hours of July 12, 2016, he picked Ms Cui up from Joo Koon MRT station in his car, purportedly to meet his supervisor. Instead, he drove her to a secluded location at Gardens by the Bay, and strangled her. According to Khoo, after she stopped moving, he lowered the seat and covered her body with laundry bags. He parked the car overnight at his condo. Khoo steadfastly denied he was in a romantic relationship with Ms Cui, even though he admitted he had affairs with many women, some of whom testified during the trial in March this year. "

Khoo did not dispute that he had strangled Ms Cui in his BMW and later burned her body in Lim Chu Kang Lane 8 over several days until nothing was left except clumps of hair, pieces of partly burnt fabric and a bra hook. But his defence argued that he should be found guilty only of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Khoo's lawyer, Mr Mervyn Cheong, said the fight in the car was sudden and Khoo had been provoked by Ms Cui's verbal taunts. The defence claimed Khoo was suffering from a mental condition known as  The prosecution, led by Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair, contended that Khoo was bent on silencing Ms Cui after she had threatened to expose him to his employer. Khoo, who is married with a son, worked as a retail outlet manager for a laundry company, while Ms Cui, a Chinese national, was a senior engineer with a semiconductor company. They met in early 2015 when Khoo helped her out of a sticky situation with her former boyfriend. They began a relationship in which Khoo told her untruths, like the laundry company was his family's business and that he was single. When her suspicions were later roused, he told her he was divorced. He also persuaded her to invest $20,000 in gold, a sum of money she had borrowed from her parents to give him. The lovers had frequent quarrels over Khoo spending too much time with his ""ex-wife"" and son and over Ms Cui's money, which he had secretly used for another purpose. In July 2016, Khoo asked a former lover to remit $10,000 to a bank account belonging to Ms Cui's father, but when Ms Cui realised she had got only half her money back, they had a heated quarrel. Meanwhile, Khoo's wife confronted him about cheating on her, after Ms Cui sent her a Facebook message to stay away from him. In the early hours of July 12, 2016, he picked Ms Cui up from Joo Koon MRT station in his car, purportedly to meet his supervisor. But instead, he drove her to a secluded location near Gardens by the Bay and strangled her in the front passenger seat. According to Khoo, after she stopped moving, he lowered the seat and covered her body with laundry bags to hide it from view. He then parked his car overnight at his condo. Khoo steadfastly denied he had been in a romantic relationship with Ms Cui, even though he admitted he had affairs with many women, some of whom testified during the trial in March this year. "

The High Court heard yesterday that the girl, who was 11 at the time, had sent the accused a text message, saying that she liked him but knew he was married. When he responded that men could have four wives, she asked if her age was a concern for him. ""Age (is) just a number,"" he replied. He was yesterday sentenced to 10 years' jail and six strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to statutory rape. Three other charges - for committing an indecent act with a child, sexual assault by penetration, and possessing obscene films - were taken into consideration. The parties are not named in order to protect the identity of the victim, who is now 13. The court heard that the victim and her family moved into the same neighbourhood as the accused in July 2017. The two families soon became close and had regular gatherings at their homes. Early last year, the girl's stepfather hired the man to work in his transport company as an operations manager. The girl began chatting with the accused on WhatsApp, unbeknownst to their families, and expressed her feelings for him on March 16 last year. In their WhatsApp messages, he called her ""darling"" and they sent each other pornographic videos. On the afternoon of May 10 that year, the girl agreed to go to his flat at his suggestion. Nobody was at home as he touched her sexually on his bed. Five days later, he picked her up in the van and asked her to sit on a sofa at the back of the vehicle. He parked on Deck 6A of a nearby multi-storey carpark and had unprotected sex with her on the sofa. The offences came to light on June 11 that year after the girl's parents became suspicious that she was communicating with the accused, and questioned her. The stepfather called the police after confronting the accused, who admitted what he had done. Defence counsel Mohamed Fazal Abdul Hamid said that it was not a case of ""one-way traffic"" and that the accused had not expressly told the girl to keep the affair a secret. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kavita Uthrapathy countered that the girl, being a child, was not in a position to appreciate or understand the implications of the sexual relationship. "

But the executive was arrested after a journalist in the United States tipped off the Singapore authorities about the planned hit. Yesterday, Allen Vincent Hui Kim Seng, 47, pleaded guilty in court to one count of intentionally abetting ""Camorra Hitmen"" to kill Mr Tan Han Shen, 30. Hui was a married man when he started an extramarital relationship with Ms Ng Woan Man, one of his colleagues, on April 22, 2016. They continued with the affair even after he left their firm in November that year. Details about the firm were not revealed in court documents. Ms Ng, who was also 30 then, ended the relationship in February last year after realising he had no intention of leaving his wife. The woman met her new boyfriend while working at another firm, and they started dating on April 27 last year. When Hui found out, he became jealous and stalked her to find out more about the man. On May 6 last year, he went to the Camorra Hitmen website and asked for Mr Tan's right hand to be cut off. While there was no mention in court documents of whether the people Hui communicated with on the Dark Web were real hitmen or scammers, the Camorra is an Italian mafia-type crime syndicate. The court heard that Hui later amended the order and asked for Mr Tan ""to be rendered unable to use his right hand for life"" instead. Hui was told he would have to pay the hitman only after the job was done. But before that, he had to transfer sufficient bitcoins into his account on the Camorra Hitmen website as proof of his ability to pay. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua told District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan: ""In accordance with Ca-morra Hitmen's instructions, the accused purchased 0.03 bitcoin valued at $600 on a bitcoin trading website and transferred the bitcoin into his Camorra Hitmen account to facilitate the hit."" Three days later, Hui waited near Ms Ng's flat and spotted Mr Tan taking her home in a car. After noting down the vehicle's number plate, he tailed the man to Hougang in his own car, the court heard. Hui then contacted Camorra Hitmen and wanted acid to be poured on Mr Tan's face. He also transferred about $3,000 worth of bitcoins to his Camorra Hitmen account. However, Camorra Hitmen later told him that they were against the use of acid as it made avoiding detection more difficult. They suggested that the man be killed instead in a staged car accident or robbery. The court heard that on May 10 last year, they told him that the price of a kill job was an additional US$5,000 (S$6,800). Hui, who found this price too steep, asked for a staged car accident to leave Mr Tan crippled for life. He transferred another $3,200 worth of bitcoins to his Camorra Hitmen account. DPP Chua said: ""However, a few hours later, the accused changed his mind again as he was still intent on murdering the victim. ""He tried to bargain with Camorra Hitmen and asked if they could still proceed with the kill job if he added another US$1,000 worth of bitcoin into his account. Camorra Hitmen affirmed that they could do so."" The DPP added that the murder was to take place between 7pm and 8pm on May 22 that year. But on May 12 last year, a journalist from US-based media company CBS contacted and informed the Singapore Embassy in Washington about the ""hit"". Court documents did not say how the journalist found out about the plan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs alerted the Singapore Police Force, and officers arrested Hui five days later.

This, despite the fact that an 18-month mandatory treatment order (MTO) has been recommended for part-time English teacher Christina Cheong Yoke Lin, 63, who was found to be suffering from a major depressive disorder when she committed the offence. Those given an MTO have to undergo treatment for their mental conditions in lieu of jail time. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Leong Wing Tuck told District Judge Ng Peng Hong that according to a report from the Institute of Mental Health on Dec 19 last year, Cheong's disorder was of a ""mild severity"". The DPP also said Cheong had ""played along"" with the love scammer. Defence lawyer Aaron Lee, who urged the court to sentence his client to an MTO, said his client was suicidal. He told Judge Ng that Cheong ""didn't go looking for fraud"" but was ""looking for love"" instead. Mr Lee also stressed that Cheong had made full restitution. Cheong pleaded guilty in May to dishonestly misappropriating the cash. The Singaporean met a man known only as Collins through online dating platform Badoo in early August 2017. She told him that she was in debt and he then asked if she would allow his boss' associates to make use of her bank accounts. DPP Ng Jun Chong told the court in May: ""Collins explained that the accused could take $500 out of each transaction and bring the rest of the money to Johor Baru, Malaysia. ""After asking why the money could not be paid directly into his boss' account, and if she would get into trouble for carrying 'lots of money', the accused agreed to 'try out' the arrangement."" The court heard that a 54-year-old victim of a love scam transferred $50,030 to Cheong's bank account on Aug 17, 2017. Collins then told Cheong to pass $50,000 to one of his boss' associates, but she decided to keep the money. On Aug 21, 2017, Cheong transferred $31,000 to a Malaysian bank account as she wanted to help another man with whom she was in love. However, the man, known only as Mark Anthony, was also a scammer who told her he was purportedly detained by the Malaysian authorities. Cheong was caught after the Singaporean woman linked to Collins' love scam alerted the police on Sept 22 that year. Court documents did not state the outcome of the case involving Collins. Cheong is now out on bail of $25,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Aug 22. "

Loh Izel Feizal, who is currently behind bars for drug-related offences, has become the first person in Singapore to be convicted in court over his usage of a non-compliant personal mobility device (PMD). The court heard that he rode the e-scooter along Mountbatten Road at around 7pm on May 15 last year. Land Transport Authority (LTA) prosecutor Daniel Marini said the agency takes a serious view of non-compliant PMDs used on public paths. He told the court that the requirements on the weight, width or speed of PMDs were imposed to protect the public, as well as to minimise the potential harm and the likelihood of accidents occurring. He added: ""There is an ever-increasing prevalence of incidents involving PMDs and there is a need for general deterrence. It was reported that about 1,700 active mobility offences were detected in the first half of 2019, of which about 30 per cent... were related to riders using non-compliant devices."" The Straits Times reported on July 2 that over 85,000 e-scooters were registered with the LTA before the deadline to do so ended on June 30. In an earlier statement, the LTA said that almost 1,000 registrations were recorded on the last day. Five days later, The Sunday Times stated that the number of reported accidents involving PMDs on public paths has increased. There were 228 such cases in 2017 and last year. Of these, 196 sustained injuries and one rider died after his PMD skidded. With the passing of the June 30 deadline, it is now illegal for PMD users to ride, cause or allow another person to ride an unregistered e-scooter on public paths. Registration for e-scooters opened on Jan 2 to deter reckless riding and to facilitate enforcement efforts against errant riders. Those registering must be at least 16 years old and declare that their e-scooters do not exceed 20kg in weight and 70cm in maximum width. The maximum motorised device speed should also be capped at 25kmh. First-time offenders convicted of riding a non-compliant PMD on a public path can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $5,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. On Monday, 48-year-old Aidel Ja'apar was fined $700 after becoming the first person here to be convicted of riding a non-compliant power-assisted bicycle under the Active Mobility Act. "

However, the judge gave Ewe a sentencing discount for cooperating with investigations, making partial restitution and contesting the charges solely on the legal issue of whether he pocketed the money ""in the way of his business as an agent"". Justice Chan also took into account Ewe's age, in the light of the long jail time that he faces, to further tweak the total sentence downwards ""to avoid giving a sentence that is tantamount to a life imprisonment term"".

The insurer said Mr Tan, 54, had offered loyalty bonuses to those who left with him and had agents sign non-disclosure agreements while he planned the move. In a High Court trial that started yesterday, Prudential is claiming ""significant and long-lasting loss"" over the alleged poaching by Mr Tan. It estimates its losses in profits to be around $300 million if the agents had stayed on to 2025; and if they stayed in perpetuity, the losses would amount to $2.5 billion. The time frames were taken in view of a Pegasus Agreement that Mr Tan signed with Prudential just a year before the mass defection. It contained projections of his and his agents' performance for at least 10 years, suggesting Prudential's losses were unlikely to be limited to a short period of time, the court heard. Mr Tan joined Prudential as an agent in 1997, rising through the ranks to become a group agency manager in 2006. He built and led the Peter Tan Organisation (PTO) until 2016, when he left Prudential. At its height, the sales force he recruited and trained was the largest, most productive sales force in Prudential, numbering some 500 agents and agency leaders. But nearly 200 of these resigned over three days in June 2016, with more following later. Prudential accused Mr Tan of ""surreptitiously"" orchestrating the mass defection to Aviva and its subsidiary financial advisory firm from May to July 2016. It also said Aviva ""furnished a war chest of at least $100 million to $150 million"" to recruit from PTO, and expected to get a base of 250 agents. • Mr Tan became an insurance agent after 12 years in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), which sponsored his university studies. • He had been a captain in the army and was about to be made a major, but left the SAF in 1996, just as Asia was entering a financial crisis.  •He decided to enter the insurance industry despite getting other offers, he told The Sunday Times in 2012, as he believed he would have more control over his career as a salesman than as a salaried worker, particularly in a recession. • He joined Prudential Assurance Company Singapore as an agent in 1997 and earned $15,000 in his first year. This soared to $300,000 in his third year on the job. • He later formed the Peter Tan Organisation (PTO), an alliance of agents within Prudential that came under his stewardship. It became the top-earning agency in the company. • At its peak, the PTO had around 500 agency leaders and agents. <strong>Seow Beiyi</strong> PTO was the top producer at Prudential before the exodus, and generated $141 million in new business profits as well as a total annual premium equivalent of $192 million from 2011 to 2015. If Mr Tan, who earned $9.7 million in the year before he defected, could get another 100 agents on board, he would receive an annual bonus as well, Prudential's lawyers from Rajah & Tann, led by Mr K. Muralidharan Pillai, said in their opening statement yesterday. ""The defendants would like the court to believe that this mass migration... was the result of coincidence, normal attrition and possibly even loyalty to (Mr Tan),"" lawyer Paul Tan of Rajah & Tann told the court. ""One swallow may not make a summer, but 244 agents make it an unlawful, illegitimate en bloc solicitation of Prudential's agents."" Prudential's lawyers also said in their submissions to the court that Mr Tan compelled agents to sign non-disclosure agreements, travel to Guangzhou from May 26 to 29, 2016, to discuss the defection, and warned them not to inform Prudential of the move. They said he held at least 12 meetings with agents. Mr Tan, represented by law-yers from TSMP Law Corporation led by Senior Counsel Thio Shen Yi, contends that the regulatory and commercial landscape made Aviva's model more attractive and that it was decisive in causing the defection. Mr Tan also argues that regardless of his acts, his departure from Prudential would have caused several other senior agency leaders to leave with some agents - which the insurer contests. Prudential argues Mr Tan had to persuade the agents to move. It said as well that Mr Tan breached his fiduciary duties, which could arise from the fact that he had influence over Prudential's agents and could thus directly affect the company's economic interests. The insurer is also suing PTO Management and Consultancy (PTOMC), of which Mr Tan is the sole shareholder and director. It claims PTOMC had assisted Mr Tan's breaches of fiduciary duties. Mr Tan, through his lawyers, is counter-claiming that Prudential terminated his service in an invalid manner, causing him loss and damage as well. "

Those given an MTO have to undergo treatment for their mental conditions in lieu of jail time. On Tuesday (July 16), Deputy Public Prosecutor Leong Wing Tuck told District Judge Ng Peng Hong that according to a report from the Institute of Mental Health on Dec 19 last year, her disorder was of a ""mild severity"". The DPP also said she had ""played along"" with the love scammer. Defence lawyer Aaron Lee, who urged the court to sentence his client to an MTO, said his client was suicidal. He told Judge Ng that Cheong ""didn't go looking for fraud"" but was ""looking for love"" instead. Mr Lee also stressed that she had made full restitution. Cheong pleaded guilty in May to dishonestly misappropriating the cash. The Singaporean had met a man known only as Collins through online dating platform Badoo in early August 2017. She told him that she was in debt and he then asked if she would allow his boss' associates to make use of her bank accounts. DPP Ng Jun Chong told the court in May: ""Collins explained that the accused could take $500 out of each transaction and bring the rest of the money to Johor Baru, Malaysia. ""After asking why the money could not be paid directly into his boss' account, and if she would get into trouble for carrying 'lots of money', the accused agreed to 'try out' the arrangement."" The court heard that a 54-year-old victim of a love scam transferred $50,030 to Cheong's bank account on Aug 17, 2017. Collins then told Cheong to pass $50,000 to one of his boss' associates, but she decided to keep the money. On Aug 21, 2017, Cheong transferred $31,000 to a Malaysian bank account as she wanted to help another man with whom she was in love. However, the man, known only as Mark Anthony, was also a scammer who had told her that he was purportedly detained by the Malaysian authorities. Cheong was caught after the 54-year-old Singaporean woman linked to Collins' love scam alerted the police on Sept 22 that year. Court documents did not state the outcome of the case involving Collins. Cheong is now out on bail of $25,000 and is expected to be sentenced on Aug 22. For dishonestly misappropriating the money, she could have been jailed for up to two years and fined. "

Loh Izel Feizal, who is currently behind bars for drug-related offences, has become the first person in Singapore to be convicted in court over his use of a non-compliant personal mobility device (PMD). The court heard that he rode the e-scooter along Mountbatten Road at around 7pm on May 15 last year. Land Transport Authority (LTA) prosecutor Daniel Marini said that the authority takes a serious view of non-compliant PMDs used on public paths as they endanger public safety. He told the court that the requirements on the weight, width and speed of PMDs are imposed to protect the public; to minimise the potential harm as well as the likelihood of accidents occurring. Mr Marini added: ""There is an ever-increasing prevalence of incidents involving PMDs and there is a need for general deterrence. ""It was reported that about 1,700 active mobility offences were detected in the first half of 2019, of which about 30 per cent... were related to riders using non-compliant devices."" The Straits Times reported on July 2 that  In an earlier statement, the LTA said that of the total, almost 1,000 registrations were recorded on the last day. Five days later, The Sunday Times said that the number of reported accidents involving PMDs on public paths had increased. There were 228 such cases in 2017 and last year. Of these, 196 resulted in injuries and one rider died after his PMD skidded. With the passing of the June 30 deadline, it is now illegal for PMD users to ride, cause or allow another person to ride an unregistered e-scooter on public paths. Registration for e-scooters opened on Jan 2 this year to deter reckless riding and to facilitate enforcement efforts against errant riders. Those who registered must be at least 16 years old and declare that their e-scooters do not exceed 20kg in weight and 70cm in width. The e-scooter's motorised device speed should also be capped at 25kmh. First-time offenders convicted of riding a non-compliant PMD on a public path can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $5,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. Meanwhile on Monday, 48-year-old Aidel Ja’apar was fined $700 after becoming the first person in Singapore to be convicted of riding a non-compliant power-assisted bicycle under the Active Mobility Act.

His name had been misspelt on his Singapore work permit and, consequently, on the police gazette issued for his arrest, the court heard. Arumugam, now a 61-year-old grandfather, was sentenced to 81/2 years in jail after he pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He was 28 years old in 1986 when he was hired to do odd jobs by the victim, Mr Muthiah Kutha Lingam, 43, also a Malaysian. The court heard that Mr Muthiah, a construction worker who also supplied labour for projects, paid Arumugam $10 at the end of each day instead of the agreed sum of $45. On Aug 28 that year, Arumugam went to Mr Muthiah's hut in Lorong Kabong - a road near Choa Chu Kang that has been replaced by a stretch of the Pan-Island Expressway - to discuss his unpaid wages amounting to about $1,000. After they had some beers, Arumugam lashed out at Mr Muthiah, who explained that he was still waiting to be paid by his boss. They got into a scuffle. When Mr Muthiah was lying on his back, Arumugam picked up a hammer lying nearby and repeatedly struck him on the head and chest with the tool. As Mr Muthiah lay groaning in pain, Arumugam threw the hammer on the ground and left. He took a taxi to Woodlands Checkpoint and went to Johor Baru. Mr Muthiah's body was discovered that evening by another worker. Police found him lying on a mattress, with his head on two pillows soaked with blood. A blood-stained hammer weighing about 1kg was also recovered at the hut. An autopsy found five fractures on his skull and chest. Yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kelly Ho sought at least nine years in jail, arguing that Arumugam's ""vicious attack"" with a deadly weapon caused the victim to suffer a slow and painful death. She argued that instead of helping the victim, Arumugam fled the country. He did not surrender himself to the police and ""brazenly"" crossed the border from Malaysia a few times over the years. But defence counsel Siraj Shaik Aziz argued that Arumugam did not deliberately evade arrest and was only returning home. Arumugam had no idea that he was wanted for killing the victim, who was alive when he last saw him, he added. The misspelling of his name on his work permit was not something that had occurred to his client as he was educated in Tamil, said the lawyer. Mr Siraj Shaik sought eight years in jail, arguing his client had cooperated with the police after his arrest. "

Kelvin Liu Chin Chan was found guilty of one charge under the Protection from Harassment Act, brought by the woman's husband, civil servant Desmond Tay Kwang Ju. Liu, 44, committed the offence between June 2016 and January 2017 while married to another woman. On July 6 last year, during the trial, Mr Tay said Liu had harassed him with text messages and photographs intended to belittle him and cause him distress. In his testimony, Mr Tay, who turns 40 this year and is attached to the Singapore Consulate General in Shanghai, said he learnt of the alleged affair when Liu's then wife contacted him in May 2016. She alleged that his then wife, identified only as Madam Lin, was planning a trip to Hong Kong with Liu the following month. Mr Tay revealed that after being told of the alleged affair, he hired a private investigator and found out that his wife and Liu had travelled to Hong Kong from June 7 to 10 that year. However, Madam Lin later denied that she was cheating. To clarify the issue, she got her husband to create a chat group with all four parties included. But in the group, which he named ""Confessions of Marco Polo"", Liu sent belittling and humiliating messages, calling Mr Tay an ""idiot"" and a ""wayang king"". Liu also asserted that Mr Tay was lying about the nature of Madam Lin's alleged affair. Mr Tay said Liu also sent him two photos - a topless picture of Mr Tay taken by Madam Lin in private and a photo of a shirtless torso with the face obscured, believed to be Liu. Mr Tay said: ""I think he wanted to let me know that he had something private of me and make me feel vulnerable. It felt like he was trying to say he was superior to me in physique, which is why my wife is with him and not me."" It was heard in court that Mr Tay's wife filed for divorce in August 2016. But he filed a defence and counterclaim on the basis of adultery. During the trial, Liu claimed Mr Tay had made several threats to him through third parties. He also produced WhatsApp conversations in court in which Mr Tay called him ""a real joke"" and said he was prepared to tell everyone about the case. The Straits Times understands that Liu is now married to Madam Lin. The case has been adjourned to Aug 13 for a hearing on the issue of costs. Liu belongs to one of Singapore's richest families. His grandfather was the late billionaire Tay Tee Peng, and their family made the Forbes list of wealthy individuals. "

The items were found in Ler's bag when he and tutor Sim Eng Chee were arrested on March 2 last year, after drugs and drug-related items were found in Sim's hotel room. Ler, 38, is accused of injecting illegal drugs into Sim - a service known as ""slamming"" - and faces another charge of possessing drug utensils. Taking the witness stand on the fifth day of his trial, Ler told the court that the straws were to be folded into origami stars and dog figurines, and that he had intended to dispose of the syringe but had forgotten about it for six months. He claimed that the straws and syringe were taken from the study room of his former partner, American Mikhy Farrera-Brochez, 34. Ler is serving a two-year jail sentence for helping the HIV-positive Farrera-Brochez dupe the authorities into allowing the American to work here. Both men are also at the centre of the HIV Registry data leak scandal. Sim earlier testified to frequently hiring Ler for his ""slamming"" services, typically doing so ahead of having sex with other men. But Ler denied this yesterday, and said that he provided ""health advisory services"" to Sim, including sports massages and prostate massages. They had met in August 2017, when Sim contacted him via gay dating app Grindr. ""He told me he was going to meet a sex buddy after I'm done... So I told him I had some experience doing prostate massage,"" said Ler. The massage services and arts and crafts projects were his two methods of supplementing his income, said Ler, as he was not sure if he could renew his doctor's practising certificate in the light of the court proceedings against him for cheating-related offences. When narcotics officers asked Ler about the syringe in his bag on March 2, he told them that it was an insulin syringe. He later told them that he used it to dislodge food particles in his teeth, a practice that he learnt from Farrera-Brochez. ""Subsequently, when results (from the Health Sciences Authority) came back... I remembered that I recovered this syringe from the study room of my ex-partner,"" said Ler. The straws were also obtained from Farrera-Brochez's study, he added. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Nicholas Wuan asked Ler whether he agreed with the proposition that Farrera-Brochez would not have left the syringes lying around if the American man had HIV. Ler replied: ""I have no information to answer that."" DPP Wuan further added that Ler had not made a single mention of the alleged massage services in his statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers . ""I put it to you that the defences you have raised in your statements to the CNB are afterthoughts,"" said DPP Wuan. Ler's trial will continue later this month. "

The second vehicle that Mr He booked soon arrived and he was about to close the front passenger door when Hidir stopped him. He then punched Mr He's mouth, drawing blood. The court heard that the victim did not retaliate but alerted the police instead. An ambulance took him to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital where he was found to have lost two teeth. Two others that were ""severely palatally displaced"" had to be extracted. The DPP told the court that Mr He's root tips were also fractured, adding: ""The victim is currently undergoing treatment to obtain dental implants to replace his missing teeth... and was given eight days of medical leave."" Hidir was offered bail of $10,000 and was ordered to surrender at the State Courts on July 26 to begin serving his sentence. For assault, he could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. "

Employees related how the masked man entered ValueMax at Block 213, Bedok North Street 1, at about 1.50pm brandishing the blade, before he swung it on the glass counter. Although the thick glass counter cracked slightly, it did not break - unlike the man's weapon, which snapped into two pieces. After picking them up, he fled without taking anything else with him. Police, who were alerted before 2pm yesterday, are investigating the incident. An employee at the shop, 66-year-old Choo Yong Chang, said he believed the culprit was in his 40s. When The Straits Times visited the shop at around 4pm, the business appeared to have returned to normal, although a piece of masking tape covered the cracked display case. Mr Choo said that while the shop was insured, the staff there had feared that the robber would hack at them with the weapon. In August last year, a ValueMax pawnshop near Boon Lay MRT station also survived a robbery attempt when 29-year-old Bangladeshi national Sheikh Md Razan threw an object on the shop's counter, falsely claiming it was a bomb. He also failed to steal anything and was arrested five days later. He was later charged with attempted armed robbery. "

The girl, who was eight when the abuse started, would cry when she had to return from her weekend stay with her biological father to the flat she shared with her mother and stepfather. Her father found out about the abuse only after her cries turned hysterical on one occasion. Yesterday, the stepfather, a 42-year-old canteen helper, was sentenced to 15 years' jail and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. He pleaded guilty earlier this month to a charge of sexual assault by penetration of a minor and two charges of molestation of a minor. Another seven molestation charges were taken into consideration. In sentencing, Justice Valerie Thean rejected his lawyer's plea for judicial mercy on the basis that the man was legally blind and diagnosed with glaucoma, which would cause him undue hardship in prison. The judge said there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant the exercise of judicial mercy and she has been assured the prison authorities would be able to manage his condition. The parties cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity. The court heard that the girl's parents divorced in 2009, with the mother getting custody of all four children. The father, who remarried, was granted access to the children on alternate Sundays. After the mother remarried in 2013, the children lived in the same flat with their mother, the accused, the couple's two children, their mother's parents and grandaunt, and a domestic worker. The victim slept in the same room as her mother, stepfather and step-siblings. In January 2015, when the girl was in Primary 3, the man began sexually abusing her, even though his wife slept in the same room and often on the same bed. The girl either pretended to be asleep while he violated her or resisted by turning her body away. On Oct 17, 2016, she cried hysterically and refused to enter the flat when her father took her and her siblings home. She revealed the abuse to him and he made a police report the next day. "

The driver, Muhammad Hidir Mohammad Alimon, 32, pleaded guilty on Friday (July 12) to an assault charge and was sentenced to five months' jail. He was also ordered to pay Mr He $9,146 in compensation. This was the out-of-pocket amount the victim paid for his medical fees.

Hidir arrived in a black Audi soon after and noticed that Mr He's two young children, aged four and seven, could be below 1.35m tall. As such, they needed booster seats. This is according to requirements by the Land Transport Authority. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li said that as the car was not equipped with the seats, Hidir told Mr He that he could not take them to their destination.

""The accused added that the 'common' or 'normal' price of procuring sexual services from a minor in the Philippines could go as low as 5,000 pesos."" In his defence, Hartung, who is represented by lawyer Mohamed Niroze Idroos, testified during the trial that he was merely ""playing along"" in the chats on Yahoo and the BDSM website and that he had no intention to plan any tours for the four men. In their submissions, the DPPs told Judge Ng: ""He also wants this court to believe that the information he provided was general information that could easily be obtained from the Internet. ""He claims that he 'played along' and provided the officers with the information because he did not want to offend them."" The prosecutors stressed that Skype chat logs between Hartung and one of his contacts known only as ""imelda.parado"" proved otherwise. For instance, in 2015, he had stated: ""What age can you get.

In the lawsuit, Aik Chuan Construction said JLC managing partner Jeffrey Ong Su Aun had asked for the loan in July last year for the ""operational needs"" of his law firm. Aik Chuan Construction, which is represented by Engelin Teh Practice, is seeking to recover $3 million, which it says is the unpaid amount of the loan despite repeated demands. JLC's lawyer, Mr Christopher Anand Daniel from Advocatus Law, told The Straits Times yesterday that his client intends to defend the suit. Ong and JLC made headlines in May after $33 million parked with the law firm, belonging to a precision engineering company, went missing. In a bourse filing on May 23, Catalist-listed Allied Technologies said the $33 million, deposited in an escrow account with JLC, is believed to have been paid out on the instructions of Ong. A day earlier, Allied Technologies announced it would be calling off its proposed acquisition of Aik Chuan Construction and its subsidiaries. Ong, who had left Singapore via the Tuas Checkpoint on May 13, was caught in Malaysia on May 29. He was found with a stolen Malaysian passport issued to a man of around the same age who bore some resemblance to him. He was taken back to Singapore on May 30 and is now remanded in custody on cheating and forgery charges. On June 27, Aik Chuan Construction sued JLC over the loan. Court documents filed by the builder say its managing director Lim Yew Ming had verbally agreed to lend JLC $5 million at a meeting with Ong and two other Aik Chuan Construction representatives on July 9 last year. On the same day, a $5 million cheque issued by Aik Chuan Construction was made out to JLC and handed to Ong, who indicated the sum will be fully repaid in a month, said the filing. Aik Chuan Construction said on Aug 6 last year, Mr Lim sent a text message to Ong, asking about repayment. Ong called him the next day, saying JLC would be able to make only partial repayment for the time being. Later that month, JLC issued a $2 million cheque to Aik Chuan Construction. On Sept 14, Ong gave a written acknowledgement of the outstanding debt of $3 million, said the court documents. Through its lawyers, Aik Chuan Construction demanded repayment on May 24 and June 19 this year. A pre-trial conference for the lawsuit is scheduled on Aug 8. "

The Straits Times had earlier reported that the gas oil had been stolen over several years in incidents dating back to 2014 from Shell's refinery on Pulau Bukom, the largest petrochemical production and export centre in the Asia-Pacific region. Yesterday, a district court heard that Dang Van Hanh, 38, was the first of 15 people, including eight former Shell employees, to be dealt with in court. His case alone involved nearly 5,600 tonnes of gas oil worth more than US$2.5 million (S$3.4 million). The Vietnamese man pleaded guilty to two counts of intentionally aiding in dishonestly receiving more than 3,500 tonnes of gas oil worth about US$1.75 million. Two other similar charges involving the remaining amounts were considered during sentencing. He committed the offences thrice in 2016 and once last year. Hanh was the chief officer of the vessel Prime Sun when it docked at Shell on Pulau Bukom to load gas oil on Sept 9, 2016. The captain was another Vietnamese man, Doan Xuan Than, 47, whose case is pending. Deputy Public Prosecutor Christopher Ong said: ""The accused was aware that Prime Sun would be receiving stolen gas oil as (Than) had informed him when they berthed. The accused also assisted in preparing a stowage plan for gas oil on this occasion as well. ""(Than) asked the accused to prepare for the loading of the illegal gas oil at the appropriate moment.

The Straits Times had earlier reported that the gas oil had been stolen over several years in incidents dating back to 2014 from Shell's refinery in Pulau Bukom, the largest petrochemical production and export centre in the Asia-Pacific region. On Thursday (July 11), a district court heard that Dang Van Hanh, 38, was the first of 15 people, including eight former Shell employees, to be dealt with in court. His case alone involved nearly 5,600 tonnes of gas oil worth more than US$2.5 million (S$3.4 million) in total. The Vietnamese man pleaded guilty to two counts of intentionally aiding to dishonestly receive more than 3,500 tonnes of gas oil worth about US$1.75 million. Two other similar charges involving the remaining amounts were considered during sentencing. He committed the offences thrice in 2016 and once last year. Dang was working as the chief officer of a vessel known as the Prime Sun when it docked at Wharf 3 at Shell at Pulau Bukom to load gas oil on Sept 9, 2016. The captain of the vessel was another Vietnamese man, Doan Xuan Than, 47, whose case is still pending. Deputy Public Prosecutor Christopher Ong said: ""The accused was aware that Prime Sun would be receiving stolen gas oil as (Doan) had informed him when they berthed. The accused also assisted to prepare a stowage plan for gas oil on this occasion as well. ""(Doan) asked the accused to prepare for loading of the illegal gas oil at the appropriate moment. The accused would then assist to get his crew members ready for such loading. However, the crew members were unaware that Prime Sun was receiving stolen gas oil."" The court heard that nearly 2,000 tonnes of gas oil valued at around US$800,000 were unlawfully transferred that day. According to Dang, on each occasion where he helped to receive stolen gas oil on board Prime Sun, Doan would pay him between US$1,000 and US$2,000. Dang was the chief officer of Prime South, a Panama-registered tanker, when the vessel arrived in Singapore on Jan 4 last year. It is owned by Prime Shipping Corporation located in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Before arriving here, the captain, who was also not named in court documents, told him that they would be receiving stolen gas oil. On Jan 7 last year, nearly 1,600 tonnes of gas oil worth more than US$960,000 were unlawfully transferred for Shell at Pulau Bukom to Prime South. However, police boarded the tanker later that day to arrest Dang and other individuals. He has made no restitution to Shell, the court heard. DPP Ong said: ""The offender was effectively caught red-handed after a police operation... that led to the arrest of multiple individuals across Singapore. ""Investigations have since uncovered the misappropriation of gas oil by two syndicates of Shell employees from Shell Pulau Bukom on an unprecedented scale."" On Thursday, he urged District Judge Tan Jen Tse to sentence Dang to at least 30 months' jail, stressing that these offences ""have the potential to bring Singapore's reputation as a bunkering hub into disrepute"". Defence lawyer Vincent Chan pleaded for his client to receive not more than two years' jail. He told the court that Dang had played a ""very minor role"" in the offences. For each count of dishonestly receiving stolen property, offenders can be jailed for up to five years and fined. "

The Singaporean cut open her top, kissed her, sat on top of her and said that he wanted to marry her. Jeffry was sentenced on Thursday (July 11) to three years and four months' jail with three strokes of the cane. He pleaded guilty to one count each of molestation, housebreaking and drug consumption. The 34-year-old Myanmar national, who cannot be named due to a gag order, woke up when she felt somebody pulling her legs and saw Jeffry, who she did not know, standing nearby. He told her to keep quiet and she complied out of fear, before the employer's mother heard a disturbance and went to investigate. She shouted for her son and daughter-in-law, who confronted Jeffry. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Pei Wei said: ""The accused told them to keep quiet and leave as he had a pair of scissors with him. At this point, the children woke up and began to cry."" He allowed the maid's employer and his wife to take the children out of the room but continued holding the maid down on a mattress. Jeffry finally let the woman go and left the unit through the main door after the employer said that he would call the police. However, the intruder left behind items including his debit card and drug paraphernalia. The employer alerted the police at around 5.40am, and a resident later reported that up to 50 police officers and 17 vehicles, including four from the Special Operations Command, were deployed at the property, located in north-western Singapore.

The men - Leong Chee Wai, Toh Chew Leong and Simon E Seck Peng - pleaded guilty yesterday to more than 100 charges involving a process called ""front-running"". This occurs when a broker uses advance information of pending share orders to then place buy or sell trades through his personal account with the aim of benefiting once the stock price moves. Another 220 or so charges were taken into consideration in sentencing. This is the first front-running case prosecuted as an insider trading offence, which attracts a heavier punishment in part due to involvement of price-sensitive information. The case centred on offences committed between 2007 and 2014 involving trades in 100 counters listed on the Singapore Exchange and markets such as Hong Kong and Australia. The Singapore-listed counters included Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust, CapitaMalls Asia and Global Logistic Properties. Leong, 50, was a senior equity dealer in First State Investments Singapore (FSIS) in March 2007 when he entered into an agreement with E, also 50, to profit from confidential information he had about orders that FSIS intended to make. E would use his personal trading account with UOB Kay Hian to place orders, usually ahead of the FSIS trades being lodged. Once the share price started to rise in the wake of the usually sizeable FSIS trades, E would offload his stock to reap a profit. The money was split between the pair. Toh, 43, also an FSIS senior equity dealer at the time, joined the pair in their scheme in August 2008 and received an equal cut of the profits. Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi told the court yesterday that the activities went on undetected for seven years, and the case involves the integrity of the economic infrastructure. Leong and Toh also had information on FSIS orders that was not generally available, like their size and price range. ""That the information... was valuable cannot be disputed - the accused persons had made significant money by carrying out their own trades based on this information,"" he said in submissions to the court. He added that the information, taken with the fact that FSIS' orders were usually substantial, would have a ""material effect on the price of the shares"". All three were found guilty of offences under the Securities and Futures Act. Leong was sentenced to three years' jail, E for 30 months and Toh for 20 months. Their terms took into account the amounts of wrongful gains they have returned and the length of time they participated in the scheme. Defence lawyer Thong Chee Kun of Rajah & Tann said information involved in front-running often does not affect the inherent value of an equity, unlike in insider trading, suggesting it is less reprehensible. He added that there was no guarantee of profit, or evidence of adverse market distortion at the expense of other investors. Principal District Judge Ong Hian Sun said in sentencing he agreed with the prosecution on the general deterrence needed to maintain the integrity of the trading system. He also considered the huge profits made. FSIS said in a statement that it suspended Leong and Toh when the Monetary Authority of Singapore alerted it to the case. They left the firm after an internal probe. Corporate lawyer Robson Lee of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher called the judgment ""significant"", saying that it sends a clear signal this is not just unethical, but also illegal. "

Cavin Tan Cher Kuan, 36, presented fresh evidence to the High Court at his appeal against the sentence, showing that he had paid $10,060 to the non-profit organisation for which he was raising funds. When Tan pleaded guilty to an offence under the Charities Act last year, the facts before the district court stated that no payments were made to the organisation, En Community Services Society (ECSS). The alleged lack of payment was a factor that weighed against him in sentencing by the district judge, who said that by failing to furnish the required documents, Tan could not prove that he had raised funds for genuine charitable purposes. Yesterday, Tan's new lawyer from Invictus Law Corp submitted documentary evidence that Tan had indeed made payment to ECSS. Mr Cory Wong sought a ""high fine"", arguing that the new evidence made it clear that Tan had not deceived ECSS or donors, and that this reduced his culpability for his offences. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li did not object to the admission of fresh evidence, but argued that Tan's jail term should be reduced by two weeks. In cutting Tan's jail term, Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang said that imprisonment was still justified, but accepted that the alleged non-payment was held against Tan. As for why the payments had not been raised to the district judge, Mr Wong told Justice Tay that this was the subject of an ongoing complaint which Tan had lodged with the Law Society against his previous lawyer. Tan owned a company, Joint Creation International (JCI), which hired people to sell vouchers. He told his staff to say that the proceeds would go to charity, but JCI did not have a fund-raising licence. The company was later renamed Alliance Career Entrepreneurship (ACE), which entered into an agreement with ECSS to raise funds by selling trinkets such as key chains and luggage tags. Under the agreement, ACE would donate between $3,000 and $5,000 to ECSS every month. ACE had a fund-raising licence, which had not been renewed, following complaints of its aggressive sales tactics. The COC ordered the company to provide documents relating to its fund-raising activities, as well as information such as its expenditure. To date, Tan has not complied. He is the first person to be prosecuted for flouting such an order. Last year, he pleaded guilty to four charges: one count each of collecting donations without a licence, failing to provide information to the COC, dealing with fake designer apparel and using criminal force on a police officer. In January, Tan was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail and a $2,000 fine. He appealed against the sentences imposed on two of the charges; namely, four weeks' jail for the fund-raising offence and 12 weeks' jail for the charity offence. Yesterday, the 12-week term was halved, resulting in a total jail sentence of 10 weeks. "

At around 6.20am three days later, he sent a text message to his brother in Singapore, claiming that someone had taken his passport and other belongings and was demanding US$15,000 from him. He told his brother that the ""local mafia"" was holding him hostage and did not think he could ""leave the place safely"". Vincent Lau also sent similar messages to their mother, who told Mr Lau to transfer money to him. Mr Lau did as he was told and transferred $1,000 to his brother's bank account at around 7.45pm that day. He alerted the police after he failed to contact Vincent Lau. Deputy Public Prosecutor Genevieve Pang said that the Special Investigations Section of the Criminal Investigation Department and the Crisis Negotiation Unit of the SPF were activated soon after. She added: ""The SPF also liaised with Vietnam Interpol to establish the whereabouts of the accused. ""After the investigations had commenced, the accused continued to deceive (his family members) by sending them messages claiming that the 'local mafia' would chop off his fingers and were threatening to kill him if they did not receive the money. ""The accused continued sending these messages to the victim over a period of three days."" Through their investigations, Vietnam Interpol and the SPF found out that Vincent Lau had lied about being kidnapped. He was arrested when he returned to Singapore on March 20. The court heard that he has made full restitution to his brother. For cheating, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

Sim was referred to Ler on Grindr, an app for gay people to meet one another, and later contacted Ler to ask if he provided ""slamming"" services. He told the court that he preferred to have someone else do it for him as it was ""less stressful"". Sim began engaging Ler - who went by the moniker Altitude - to inject methamphetamine, which he described as a sexual stimulant.

Occasionally, Ler asked him for a substance called ""G water"", which Sim said would ""lift the high"" of other drugs such as Ecstasy. He gave Ler bottles of ""G water"" in lieu of payment for his services. On Feb 26 last year, Sim engaged Ler again for a ""slamming"" session at Swissotel The Stamford, where he had booked a room for a romp with two men. Ler left after administering the drug, he said. On March 2, Sim had another session, this time at the Conrad Centennial Singapore. He went to buy drugs in Geylang, and lined up sexual partners by reaching out to people on Grindr and his own contact list.

This was after Cavin Tan Cher Kuan, 36, presented fresh evidence to the High Court at his appeal against the sentence, showing that he had paid $10,060 to the non-profit organisation for which he was raising funds. When  The alleged lack of payment was a factor that weighed against him in sentencing by the district judge, who said that by failing to furnish the required documents, Tan could not prove he had raised funds for genuine charitable purposes. On Wednesday, Tan's new lawyer from Invictus Law Corporation submitted documentary evidence that he had indeed made payment to ECSS. Mr Cory Wong sought a ""high fine"", arguing that the new evidence made it clear that Tan had not deceived ECSS or donors, and this reduced his culpability for his offences. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li did not object to the fresh evidence being admitted, but argued that Tan's jail term should be reduced by two weeks. In cutting Tan's jail term, Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang said imprisonment terms are still justified but accepted that the alleged non-payment was held against Tan. As for why the payments had not been raised to the district judge, Mr Wong told Justice Tay this was the subject of an ongoing complaint that Tan has lodged with the Law Society against his previous lawyer. Tan owned a company, Joint Creation International (JCI), which hired people to sell vouchers. He instructed his staff to say that the proceeds would go to charity, but JCI did not have a licence for fund raising. The company was later renamed Alliance Career Entrepreneurship (ACE), which entered into an agreement with ECSS to raise funds by selling trinkets such as keychains and luggage tags. Under the agreement, the company would donate between $3,000 and $5,000 to ECSS each month. ACE had a fund-raising licence but it was not renewed following multiple complaints of its aggressive sales tactics. The COC then ordered the company to provide documents relating to its fund-raising activities as well as other information such as its expenditure and identity of staff and volunteers. To date, Tan has not complied. He is the first person to be prosecuted for flouting such an order. Last year, he pleaded guilty to four charges - one count each of collecting donations without a licence, failing to provide information to the COC, dealing with fake designer apparel and using criminal force on a police officer. He was sentenced in January to a total of 16 weeks' jail and a $2,000 fine. Tan appealed against the sentences imposed on two of the charges, namely, four weeks' jail for the fund-raising offence and 12 weeks' jail for the charity offence. On his appeal on Wednesday, the 12-week term was halved, resulting in a total jail sentence of 10 weeks. "

Deputy Public Prosecutor Jean Goh told the court that the girl wanted to have some sweets at around 3pm on Jan 31 and pestered the maid for them. The woman refused to give them to her as she knew that her employer would not have agreed to the child's demands. The DPP added: ""The accused claimed that the victim insisted on having the sweets and got increasingly agitated. The victim started to grab and scratch the accused's hands while they were both in the living room. ""The accused then pushed the victim, causing her to fall backwards, and her head hit the wall.

The men - Leong Chee Wai, Toh Chew Leong and Simon E Seck Peng -  This occurs when a broker uses advance information of pending share orders to then place buy or sell trades through his personal account with the aim of benefiting once the stock price moves. This is the first front-running case prosecuted as an insider trading offence, which attracts a heavier punishment, in part due to the involvement of price-sensitive information. The case centred on offences committed between 2007 and 2014 involving around 40 Singapore-listed companies, including Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust, CapitaMalls Asia and Global Logistic Properties. Foreign-listed counters were targeted as well. Leong, 50, was a senior equity dealer in First State Investments Singapore (FSIS) in March 2007 when he entered into an agreement with E, 50, to profit from confidential information he had about orders that FSIS intended to make. His job included executing trading orders placed by FSIS's portfolio managers. E would use his personal trading account with UOB Kay Hian to place orders, usually ahead of the FSIS trades being lodged. Once the share price started to rise in the wake of the usually sizeable FSIS trades, E would offload his stock to reap a profit. The money was then split equally between the pair. Toh, 43, also a senior equity dealer at FSIS, joined the pair in their scheme in August 2008 and received an equal cut of the profits. Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi told the court on Wednesday (July 10) that the activities went on for seven years without detection. DPP Hon also noted that Leong and Toh had possessed information on FSIS orders that was not generally available, such as the size and price range. ""The information... would be expected... to be profitable if the person had traded on (it),"" he said. ""The information, taken with the fact that FSIS's orders were usually substantial, would have a material effect on the price of the shares."" All three were found guilty of offences under the Securities and Futures Act. Leong was sentenced to three years' jail, E for 30 months and Toh for 20 months. The terms took into account the different amounts of the gains they have returned and the amount of time they participated in the scheme. Defence lawyer Thong Chee Kun of Rajah & Tann said front-running, unlike insider trading, does not necessarily affect the inherent value of an equity and should be less reprehensible. He added that there was ""no guarantee of profit"" in this case or evidence of adverse market distortion caused at the expense of other investors. Principal District Judge Ong Hian Sun said in sentencing that he agreed with the prosecution that general deterrence was needed to maintain the integrity of the trading system. He also considered the huge profits that were made. Leong and E reaped about $2.6 million each, while Toh made around $2.3 million. "

The man, who cannot be named due to a gag order, pleaded guilty to six offences under the Children and Young Persons Act as well as to two counts of molestation. Thirteen other similar charges, including two involving a fifth boy who was then 14 years old, were considered during sentencing. The man met one of his victims, also a 14-year-old boy, in early December 2016 when the boy went swimming with three teenage male friends. As a ""godbrother"" to the victim's friends, the man would top up the trio's phone credits, the court heard. The victim told the man that he also wanted to be his godbrother and they exchanged phone numbers. A few days later, he lured the boy to his Marsiling flat when no one was home. While they were sitting on a bed, the man kissed the boy's face and performed a sexual act on him. The frightened boy told the man to stop but his pleas fell on deaf ears. He subsequently invited the teenager to an Orchard Road cinema that month and when the movie started, he placed his hand inside the boy's pants. On another occasion later that month, the man gave the boy a pack of cigarettes and a phone and asked the boy to perform oral sex on him. The boy refused and returned the phone. The accused met his earliest victim, a 13-year-old boy, through Facebook in 2014. The man molested the teenager at the void deck of a housing block in Clementi the following year. The man met another victim, then 12 years old, outside a Boon Keng Road fast-food restaurant in mid-2016 and touched the boy's genitals when the victim nodded off. Alarmed, the boy pushed his hands away. The man got to know the fourth victim via Facebook in June 2016 and treated the 13-year-old to cigarettes and food. In March 2017, the pair were at East Coast Park at around 3am when the man touched the boy's private parts. He committed a similar act that month at a park in Ang Mo Kio after treating the victim to fast food. Court documents did not reveal how the man's offences came to light.

Under the scheme, all Singaporeans aged 25 and above would receive an opening credit of $500 in their SFC account which can be used to pay for approved courses. The court heard on Monday that Tay was one of the directors of two companies, A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Between February and March 2016, WDA approved four courses to be funded by the SFC under the two firms. They were in areas such as professional selling and financial modelling. DPP Goh said Ng, also known as Sean, was the only trainer for both firms. ""Sometime in early 2016, Allister and Sean discussed an idea to increase the sales of courses offered by (their firms) by giving referral fees to persons who referred trainees to register for the... courses,"" she said. The court heard that Lim, who knew the pair during their university days, later became involved and the trio also talked about giving cash directly to trainees as part of an effort to increase sales. Lim later told Tan, his secondary school friend, about the plan. The DPP said a training provider under the SFC scheme was not supposed to pay trainees from their disbursed SFC or even enter into such agreements. In April 2016, a company known as C.G. Marketing (CGM) was set up with the sole purpose of promoting A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Lim was its sole director with Tan as its manager. Sales staff were recruited to promote the courses and one of them was Muhammad Hakimmul Hisham Razni, 35. The DPP said: ""Sean, Lim Biao, Joshua and Allister initiated a plan to cheat WDA by submitting inflated SFC claims. By having CGM give cashbacks for course registration, the plan encouraged a high sign-up rate for courses offered by A.I. Industries without trainees actually attending the courses. As a result, the WDA was cheated into delivering a total of $51,000 to A.I. Industries."" She added that Hakimmul recruited 51 trainees and a total of 102 inflated claims were submitted to WDA. He was sentenced on Monday to 24 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to nine cheating charges. "

The family of Mr Ng Kong Yeam, 80, allege that Madam Kay Swee Pin, 66, had filled in a pre-signed form to transfer his shareholding in SA Tours' parent company Natwest Holdings, which was then valued at $20 million. The case opened in the High Court yesterday, with lawyers for the family citing an e-mail exchange in 2008 in which Madam Kay complained about Mr Ng's womanising and his addiction to sex ""with no sign of love and tenderness"". In her e-mail asking Mr Ng to give SA Tours to her, Madam Kay, who was the agency's managing director, requested that he sign the form, promising not to carry out the transfer until he was ""gone"". He replied that he will leave SA Tours to her in his will. Mr Ng's family contend that after getting the signed form, Madam Kay filled it in without his knowledge and consent, transferring to herself the 799,999 shares that he held in Natwest. This made Madam Kay, who originally held one share in Natwest, the sole owner of the holding company, which also owns a $4 million apartment in Cairnhill. The form, which is dated Nov 1, 2010, was lodged with the company secretary on April 1, 2011. It states that Madam Kay paid $1 million for the shares, but the family contend that the sum has not been paid and in any case, was grossly inadequate. The Ngs, who are Malaysians, are asking the court to reverse the share transfer and are seeking at least $1 million in damages. Madam Kay's daughter with Mr Ng, 32-year-old Eva Mae, has also been named as a defendant for allegedly conspiring with her mother. Mr Ng is legally married to Madam Ling Towi Sing, 80. They own a law firm in Johor Baru and have three children, son Gabriel, 43, and daughters Irene, 55, and Iris, 47. He began an affair with Madam Kay in the 1980s and lived with her and their daughter for 20 years up till 2013. The Cairnhill apartment was their family home from 1995. Mr Ng is now living with his wife in their Johor Baru home. Madam Kay's lawyer, Mr Suresh Damodara, argued in his opening statement that Mr Ng eventually decided to sign the transfer form in November 2010 for his client's benefit. He argued that Mr Ng's family had no personal knowledge of what had transpired. He also argued that in a will Mr Ng made in August 2011, there was no reference to his Natwest shares because these had been given to Madam Kay. But the family, represented by Senior Counsel Roderick Martin, noted that Mr Ng made a later will in February 2012, in which he bequeathed his Natwest shares to his children Gabriel and Eva Mae. Mr Martin's opening statement said objective evidence showed that Mr Ng had no intention of giving the shares to Madam Kay. This included a 2012 financial statement signed by Mr Ng and Madam Kay, which stated that he had a ""deemed interest"" in the shares. The opening statement also highlighted Madam Kay's ""propensity"" to lie and forge, citing the judgment in her failed defamation suit in 2010 against the Singapore Island Country Club and her admission that she had signed Mr Ng's signature on a Lasting Power of Attorney she registered in 2012. Pointing to Madam Kay's ""salacious"" allegations in the 2008 e-mail, the lawyers questioned if Mr Ng would risk being thrown out of his business and his home by giving his shares to her during his lifetime.

Three months later, cleaner Muhammad Rozaimie Zainal robbed another woman at knifepoint in Maxwell Road and made off with $1,052 in cash. CT is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. The maximum period is 14 years. Rozaimie, 41, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (July 9) to one count each of assault and robbery. The court heard that he was sentenced to his first CT in 2003 for offences including criminal intimidation and drug consumption. He had to spend six years behind bars and ordered to receive eight strokes of the cane. After his release, he committed multiple counts of robbery and was given his second CT in 2010. That time, he was detained for eight years with the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. He was released in April last year, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Vincent Ong. On Sept 9 last year, Rozaimie went to Orchard Towers shopping centre and approached a 33-year-old Vietnamese sex worker for her services. She agreed to have sex with him for $100 and they checked into a room at the New Orchid Hotel in Balestier Road. The pair started quarrelling soon after as Rozaimie wanted to pay her only after they had sex. When the woman tried to leave, he grabbed her left hand and blocked the door. She tried to push him away and he retaliated by punching her head several times. He also scratched her face, neck and chest. The sex worker eventually managed to get away and alerted the police. She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Sept 11 and was found to have tenderness on her head and scratch marks on her body. In a separate incident on Dec 17 last year, the court heard that a Singaporean woman, identified as Ms N.S. Koh, 31, was walking towards Tanjong Pagar MRT station at around 11pm when she stopped to play a piano near the entrance of the URA Centre in Maxwell Road. Rozaimie spotted Ms Koh and decided to rob her. With a knife in his hand, he said to her: ""If you don't want anything to happen to you... give me money."" The terrified woman told him she had only $52 in her wallet. Rozaimie repeated his request and they went to an ATM at Tanjong Pagar MRT station where she withdrew $1,000. Ms Koh handed him $1,052 in total and he fled the scene. She reported the matter to the control station staff who called the police. Officers arrested Rozaimie at Lucky Plaza shopping centre two days later. DPP Ong told District Judge Jasvender Kaur that Rozaimie has made no restitution. On Tuesday, Judge Kaur called for reports to assess his suitability for CT and preventive detention (PD). According to the Singapore Legal Advice website, PD is only for repeat offenders who are above 30 years old. Compared to CT, PD involves a longer period of incarceration, lasting up to 20 years. Rozaimie's case was adjourned to July 30. On each robbery charge, offenders can be jailed for between three and 14 years, and ordered to receive at least 12 strokes of the cane. "

On Tuesday (July 9), the 26-year-old man was sentenced to four years and three months' jail, and ordered to receive six strokes of the cane. He pleaded guilty to six offences under the Children and Young Persons Act as well as two counts of molestation. Thirteen other similar charges, including two involving a fifth boy who was then 14 years old, were considered during sentencing. The man met his first victim, also a 14-year-old boy, in early December 2016 when the boy went swimming with three teenage male friends. As a ""godbrother"" to the victim's friends, the man would top up the trio's phone credits, the court heard. The victim told the man that he also wanted to be his godbrother and they exchanged phone numbers. A few days later, he lured the boy to his Marsiling flat when no one was home. While they were sitting on a bed, the man kissed the boy's face and performed a sexual act on him. The scared boy told the man to stop but his pleas fell on deaf ears. He invited the teenager to an Orchard Road cinema later that month and when the movie started, he placed his hand inside the boy's pants. Deputy Public Prosecutor Zhou Yihong said: ""The first victim felt embarrassed as there were girls around, and pushed the accused's hands away, but the accused kept putting his hands in (the boy's pants)."" On another occasion later that month, the man gave the boy a pack of cigarettes and a phone and asked the boy to perform oral sex on him. The boy refused and returned the phone. The man got to know the second victim via Facebook in June 2016 and treated the 13-year-old to cigarettes and food. In March 2017, the pair were at East Coast Park at around 3am when the man touched the boy's private parts. He committed a similar act that month at a park in Ang Mo Kio after treating the victim to fast food. The man met the third victim, then 12 years old, outside a Boon Keng Road fast-food restaurant in mid-2016 and touched the boy's genitals when the boy nodded off. Alarmed, the boy pushed his hands away. The fourth victim was a 13-year-old boy the man met through Facebook in 2014. DPP Zhou said the man molested the teenager at the void deck of a block in Clementi the following year. She added that the man apologised to the teenager when he cried. The boy was too scared to tell his parents about the incident. Court documents did not reveal how the man's offences came to light. For each count of molesting a child below 14 years old, he could have been jailed for up to five years and fined or caned. "

According to the teenager's victim impact statement, the court heard that she had also suffered a loss of self-esteem and felt scared whenever she heard the word ""tuition"". The tutor, a 48-year-old Indonesian man, was sentenced on Tuesday (July 9) to two years and a month's jail with six strokes of the cane after pleading guilty last month to three counts of molestation. The Singapore permanent resident cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the girl's identity. The man gave tuition in mathematics at his home and the girl, who was then in Secondary 3, attended classes there about thrice a week from July 2017 to March last year. Each class had between five and 12 students, the court heard. Deputy Public Prosecutor Delicia Tan said the man molested the teenager on multiple occasions by slipping his hand into her top between February and March last year. DPP Tan added: ""The accused would ask the victim to stay back after class on the pretext of wanting her to complete her homework. ""After all the other students left, the accused would then molest the victim in the classroom. On some of these occasions, the victim was wearing her school uniform."" DPP Tan told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim that the victim felt ""uncomfortable, shocked and speechless"" by her tutor's actions. However, she did not tell anyone about her ordeal as she was afraid to speak up and ""did not know how to react"". On March 9 last year, she finally decided to tell a 17-year-old male friend about what had happened and he informed her school. Two days later, school staff alerted the girl's mother, 38, who took her daughter to Pasir Ris Neighbourhood Police Centre to lodge a report on March 12 last year.

He also had to be fed through a tube inserted into the stomach. The court heard that in March last year, the woman slapped the boy, then 23 months old, so hard that he fell and hit his head on a metal table leg. This caused him to suffer severe head injuries. On another occasion, she fractured his arm by yanking it forcefully when he refused to take a bath. She also punched him more than five times in the chest when he did not listen to her instructions. The 27-year-old woman was sentenced yesterday to 6½ years' jail after pleading guilty in May to two counts of causing grievous hurt to the boy and one count of ill-treating him. She cannot be named to protect the toddler's identity. He is the second of her three sons aged between four years and one month old at the time of the incident. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua said the woman often lost her temper with the victim. The children's father did not live with them. On March 25 last year, the woman was bathing her other two children at home when she found the toddler digging into his nappy and playing with his faeces. She became angry and slapped him hard on the right cheek, the DPP said. When the boy did not stop, the woman slapped him hard on the other cheek. ""The force of the accused's slap was so great that the victim's body turned midway and the victim fell sideways, with his head hitting hard against one of the legs of a nearby metal table,"" said DPP Chua. The boy cried and his body started to shake violently as his mother tried to calm him down. She massaged him with some oil, but he became barely responsive and was semi-conscious. Instead of an ambulance, the woman called a friend for help as she was afraid that her sons would be taken away from her. But at her friend's urging, she called an ambulance about 15 minutes later. Several months later, the boy was found to have cerebral palsy. As the injuries left him unable to be fed orally, he had to undergo gastrostomy, a surgical procedure to create an artificial external opening into the stomach for nutritional support. For each charge of causing grievous hurt, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. Women are not caned. "

The company, which admitted to flying the drone on Nov 17, 2017, had pleaded guilty to an offence under the Air Navigation Order. The court heard that LT Sambo had operated the small unmanned aircraft (UA) outdoors, identified as a DJI Phantom 4 and weighing 1.38kg, without a Class 1 activity permit which is issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). The permit is needed for activities involving an unmanned aircraft that are ""not recreational or research in nature"". These include competitive races held by private organisers and businesses providing aerial surveying or photography services. A Class 1 activity permit is not valid without an unmanned aircraft operator permit, which is also granted by the CAAS. The operator permit is granted to applicants if they are able to ensure the safe operation of the drones. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Yanying said that LT Sambo was engaged to carry out underground foundation works for an MRT development project along Marine Parade Road. The firm had successfully applied for a drone operator permit which was issued on Aug 21, 2017. On Sept 27 that year, its quantity surveyor, Mr Mohamad Wadud Al Hafiz Ponijan, submitted an application to the CAAS for an activity permit to operate the drone along the road. It was to capture aerial footage of the area for its construction work plan, the court heard. The next day, CAAS told LT Sambo via e-mail that the proposed flight plan involved flying over a public road with a high concentration of human and vehicular traffic. LT Sambo was asked to provide details of proposed comprehensive risk mitigating measures for the CAAS to review, before the activity permit could be granted. However, the company failed to provide any and the CAAS did not grant it the permit. Despite this, LT Sambo's civil engineer, Mr Jung Han-Gun, made two flights with the drone over Marine Parade Road on Nov 17, 2017, each lasting about 20 minutes. On each flight, the drone was flown over an approximately 2km stretch of Marine Parade Road, at a maximum height of about the fourth storey of the nearby Housing Board blocks. The drone was on its third flight when police officers turned up. In a statement yesterday, the CAAS said it ""will not hesitate to take enforcement action against UA operators who contravene regulations"". "

Officers of the Commercial Affairs Department established the identity of the man and arrested him on Monday. Six $50 notes which are believed to be counterfeits, a printer, some printing papers and clothing were seized as case exhibits. Preliminary investigations found that the man is believed to have printed several $50 notes with his own printer and used them on at least two occasions to purchase items of low value. The man will be charged in court with counterfeiting currency notes and using counterfeit currency notes as genuine notes. Those convicted for these offences may be jailed up to 20 years and fined. In the statement, the police reminded members of the public to be wary of receiving counterfeit notes. Those who suspect they have received fake currency notes should make a report at any neighbourhood police centre or delay the person who gave the suspected fake note and call the police immediately. Members of the public should take note of the person's details, including gender, race, age, height, built, clothing, any tattoos, the language or dialect spoken, and the vehicle the person is using, if any, as well as its registration number. They should also place the suspected counterfeit notes in a protective covering, such as an envelope, to prevent further tampering, before handing them to the police.

One of them, Tay Sheng Yang, 28 , also known as ""Allister"", was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to 19 cheating charges and one count of obstructing the course of justice. He committed all the offences in 2016. The cases involving the other three men - Lim Biao, 27, Ng Yong Jing, 28, and Joshua Tan Jun Liang, also 28 - are pending. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Goh said that the SkillsFuture Credits (SFC) scheme was launched in January 2016 to encourage individuals to take ownership of their skill development and lifelong learning. Under the scheme, all Singaporeans aged 25 and above would receive an opening credit of $500 in their SFC account which can be used to pay for approved courses. The court heard that Tay was one of the directors of two companies, A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Between February and March 2016, WDA approved four courses to be funded by the SFC under the two firms. They were in areas such as professional selling and financial modelling. DPP Goh said that Ng, also known as Sean, was the only trainer for both firms. She added: ""Some time in early 2016, Allister and Sean discussed an idea to increase the sales of courses offered by (their companies) by giving referral fees to persons who referred trainees to register for the... courses.""

The DPP said that a training provider under the SFC scheme was not supposed to pay trainees from their disbursed SFC or even enter into such agreements. In April 2016, a company known as C.G. Marketing (CGM) was set up with the sole purpose of promoting A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens. Lim was its sole director with Tan as its manager. Salespeople were recruited to promote the courses and one of them was Muhammad Hakimmul Hisham Razni, 35. The DPP said: ""Sean, Lim Biao, Joshua and Allister initiated a plan to cheat WDA by submitting inflated SFC claims. By having CGM give cashbacks for course registration, the plan encouraged a high sign-up rate for courses offered by A.I. Industries without trainees actually attending the courses. As a result, the WDA was cheated into delivering a total of $51,000 to A.I. Industries."" She added that Hakimmul recruited 51 trainees and a total of 102 inflated claims were submitted to WD0. He received $5,100 in total and was sentenced on Monday to 24 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to nine cheating charges. The court was told that the offences were uncovered after WDA filed a complaint against A.I. Industries and Alliance Continens with the Commercial Affairs Department on June 1, 2016 . Tay has paid $7,650 in restitution and Hakimmul paid $5,100. Offenders can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each count of cheating. "

On March 25 last year, the mother was bathing her other two children at home when she found the toddler digging into his nappy and playing with the faeces. She became angry and slapped him hard on the right cheek, the DPP said. When the boy did not stop, the woman slapped him hard on the other cheek. ""The force of the accused's slap was so great that the victim's body turned midway and the victim fell sideways, with his head hitting hard against one of the legs of a nearby metal table,"" said DPP Chua. The boy cried and his body started to shake violently as his mother tried to calm him down. She massaged him with some oil, but he became barely responsive and was semi-conscious. Instead of an ambulance, the woman called a friend for help as she was afraid that her sons would be taken away from her. But at her friend's urging, she called an ambulance about 15 minutes later. Several months later, the boy was found to have cerebral palsy. As the injuries left him unable to be fed orally, he had to undergo gastrostomy, a surgical procedure to create an artificial external opening into the stomach for nutritional support. For each charge of causing grievous hurt, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned. Women are not caned. "

The company, which admitted to flying the drone on Nov 17, 2017, had pleaded guilty earlier to an offence under the Air Navigation Order. The court heard that LT Sambo had operated the small unmanned aircraft (UA) outdoors ""in the course of business"" without a Class 1 activity permit. The drone was identified as a DJI Phantom 4, weighing 1.38kg. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) states on its website that a Class 1 activity permit is needed for activities involving an unmanned aircraft that is ""not recreational or research in nature"". These include competitive races held by private organisers and businesses providing aerial surveying or photography services. A Class 1 activity permit is not valid without an unmanned aircraft operator permit which is also granted by the CAAS. The operator permit is granted to applicants if they are able to ensure the safe operation of the drones. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Yanying said that LT Sambo was engaged to carry out underground foundation works for an MRT development project along Marine Parade Road.  On Sept 27 that year, its quantity surveyor Mr Mohamad Wadud Al Hafiz Ponijan submitted an application to the CAAS for an activity permit to operate the drone along the road. 
It was to capture aerial footage of the area for its construction work plan, the court heard. The DPP told District Judge Luke Tan that it “posed additional potential risks of damage to property and personal safety” and that “comprehensive risk mitigating measures would be required”. LT Sambo was asked to provide details of proposed comprehensive risk mitigating measures for the CAAS to review, before the activity permit could be granted. However, the company failed to provide any and the CAAS did not grant it the permit. Despite this, LT Sambo’s civil engineer Mr Jung Han-Gun made two flights with the drone over Marine Parade Road on Nov 17, 2017, each lasting about 20 minutes. On each flight, the drone was flown over an approximately 2km stretch of Marine Parade Road, at a maximum height of about the 4th storey of the nearby Housing Board blocks. The drone was on its third flight when police officers turned up. On Monday, DPP Tan urged the court to sentence LT Sambo to a $10,000 fine. She said: “Sambo’s illegal operation of the 1.38kg drone, which would have had a ground impact speed of at least 53.34 kilometres per hour, without adequate and approved risk mitigating measures had placed unnecessary risk to safety of other persons, and damage to property.” Defence lawyer Wong Tjen Wee told Judge Tan that safety precautions were taken when the drone was flown that day.  He also said that LT Sambo has accepted full responsibility of its actions. In a statement on Monday, the CAAS said it “will not hesitate to take enforcement action against UA operators who contravene regulations”. First-time offenders can be fined up to $20,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to 15 months and fined up to $40,000. "

Yesterday, District Judge Adam Nakhoda fined Manickavasagam Saravanan $10,500 after the 41-year-old pleaded guilty to seven charges under the Goods and Services Tax (General) Regulations. The second man, Kulamani Ganesan, 31, was fined $3,000 after he admitted to two charges. Manickavasagam and Kulamani were linked to claims totalling $3,576.55 and $1,194.97 respectively. On Tuesday, four other men who also worked for the same store, Abiraame Jewellers, were fined between $1,500 and $12,000. They are Shanmugam Sampathkumar, 33; Murugesan Saravanan, 42; Pang Wei Koon, 46; and Arumugam Chelladurai, 49. Except for Pang, who is Malaysian, the other five are Indian nationals. Court documents did not state if all six men, who committed the offences in 2015 and 2016, are still working for Abiraame Jewellers. In a statement yesterday, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) said that the men were linked to a scam that fraudulently claimed GST tourist refunds amounting to more than $15,000. Five other Indian nationals were members of a syndicate that was behind the scam. Kothandaraman Gnanam, 29; Karunanidhi Rajesh, 32; Karunanithi Saravanan, 37; Ramaiyan Karthikeyan, 44; and Waithiyalingam Karunanidhi, 61, were sentenced to jail in 2017. Investigations showed the syndicate made over $167,000 in fraudulent GST tourist refund claims. Iras said that as part of their illegal scheme, syndicate members or claimants would loiter around a number of Little India jewellery stores, including Abiraame Jewellers' two outlets, to try to obtain invoices from actual customers. Tax prosecutor Emmanuel Lee told the court yesterday: ""Once a customer agreed to sell or give the invoice, a claimant would give his passport and embarkation card... to an employee of (Abiraame Jewellers) for the purpose of making an application for a GST refund under the claimant's passport number. The employee would enter the details of the claimant and the jewellery purchased into the eTRS system."" The employee would then print an eTRS refund ticket for the claimant to unlawfully obtain at the airport GST refunds which they were not entitled to.

Teo was a frequent visitor of Sammyboy Forum in the weeks leading to the killings, which government psychiatrist Derrick Yeo said cast doubt on whether he showed symptoms of depression. The issue of whether Teo, 43, was suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) was hotly debated in the High Court yesterday. He faces the death penalty on two counts of murder for strangling his wife Choong Pei Shan, 39, and their daughter Zi Ning, at their Woodlands flat on Jan 20, 2017. The defence, relying on a report by private psychiatrist Jacob Rajesh, said Teo had MDD and the condition reduced his mental responsibility for the killings. Dr Rajesh's report said Teo had symptoms of depressed mood, poor sleep, a constant sense of worthlessness, low self-esteem and hopelessness. The disorder was brought on by his mounting debts and sense of helplessness. But Dr Yeo, who is from the Institute of Mental Health, said Teo did not have any mental disorder and he was optimistic he would be able to turn his fortunes around. Deputy Public Prosecutor Han Ming Kuang said Teo surfed the sex-themed forum almost every day between Dec 1, 2016 and Jan 19, 2017. On the eve of the killings, Teo visited it 132 times.  Dr Yeo said the fact that Teo was enjoying pornography regularly ""cast an objective doubt"" over whether he showed a loss of interest in all activities, one of the symptoms of MDD. He added that while Teo had some symptoms, none were clinically significant. Dr Yeo also did not place much weight on Teo's claim of having had suicidal thoughts for a year. If Teo was really suicidal, he would have jumped over the parapet when the police were at his door, said Dr Yeo. After killing his wife and daughter, Teo watched TV, ordered food on McDelivery and surfed the Net for ways to commit suicide. He set fire to the bodies and laid next to them in a suicide attempt, but later left the flat as there was a lot of smoke. He also concocted lies to his family and his in-laws in the days after the killings. This showed ""clarity of thought"" and ""very clear planning"", said Dr Yeo. Teo also told both psychiatrists that Madam Choong had an extra-marital affair. He said that in 2014, he came home to find the man in his bedroom. He suspected Zi Ning was not his biological daughter. Teo's lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said Teo, once a successful property agent, had ""fallen"" in status to renovation firm employee. He cited anecdotes that Teo looked like a ""different person"" in January 2017 and wore the same shirt to work on most days. The trial has been adjourned. Hearing dates have yet to be fixed. "

According to court documents, Chen was said to be operating a DBPower FPV drone that weighed 0.357kg, while Tay allegedly used a ""Bumblebee wrapped DJI drone"" weighing 0.43kg. The two men face a fine of up to $20,000. The use of drones has come under scrutiny after several Changi Airport flights were diverted and more than 50 delayed on two separate occasions last month due to the presence of drones in the no-fly zone within 5km . The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) warned on its website that because of Singapore's busy airspace and densely populated urban environment, flying an unmanned aircraft (UA) or drone must be carried out ""in a safe and responsible manner"". A Class 2 activity permit is required when using drones for recreational or research purposes under any of these conditions: At operating altitudes higher than around 60m, within 5km of a civil or military aerodrome, or within any restricted or danger areas. Paya Lebar Airbase is a military installation. A panel set up by CAAS is reviewing the regulatory framework involving drones, and is likely to propose mandatory registration for drones above a certain weight and stiffer penalties for those who flout flying rules, according to a recent report.

Kings International Business School (KIBS) in Bukit Merah Central had closed its doors after it was found to have awarded diplomas in maritime studies to students who did not attend classes. One of the managers, Singaporean Pek Siew Gek, 42, was jailed for 10 weeks yesterday after pleading guilty to two counts of giving false information to the authorities. The offences were related to false items - 10 examination scripts and six attendance lists. She had also admitted to one count of failing to comply with directions from the Council for Private Education (CPE), now known as the Committee for Private Education. Last year, Pek and another manager, Chinese national Tang Yudong, 30, were convicted of one count each of abetting to obstruct the course of justice. Pek and Tang were sentenced to three months' and two months' jail respectively on July 27 last year. They appealed against the conviction and sentence, but their appeals were dismissed on June 10 this year. Pek, who now has to spend a total of three months and 10 weeks behind bars, will serve her latest sentence after completing the first one. Yesterday, Tang, who is a Singapore permanent resident, was jailed for four weeks for failing to comply with directions from the CPE. This means he will serve a total of two months and four weeks behind bars. KIBS' offences came to light in 2014 after the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore told the CPE that the school had offered the maritime studies diploma to students who did not attend classes. Pek and Tang were told by the authorities to refund more than $170,000 to students who had not completed their studies as of April 20, 2015. The 34 students were supposed to receive their full refund by July 3 that year. The pair were also ordered to make arrangements for each student to be offered a place in another registered private education institution by May 5, 2015. But they failed to comply with these directions from the CPE and so far, only about $30,350 of the course fees has been refunded. The students received their payments as late as Aug 4, 2016. Pek and Tang also did not make any arrangements for the students to be offered places in other schools. "

But there was no return on the investment despite it being capital-guaranteed with 40 per cent profit - until yesterday when the High Court held the two advisers liable to pay back the US$620,900 plus interest from 2012. Justice Choo Han Teck said financial advisers Moi Kok Keong and Alice Quek had breached their duty of care owed to Mr Saimee by negligently misrepresenting the SMLG investment to him. The judge also held IPP Financial Advisers, which engaged Mr Moi and Ms Quek as financial advisers, to be vicariously liable for the duo's negligence. ""Saimee is a vulnerable client. He is not highly educated and predominantly relied on Moi and Quek's financial advice,"" said Justice Choo. He noted that both were qualified chartered financial consultants who had been working in the industry since 1991. Mr Moi had introduced a fund manager for SMLG to Mr Saimee in April 2012, and Mr Saimee, on the advice of Mr Moi and Ms Quek, opened a trading account with FX Primus to invest the US$620,900 through SMLG. But when the first tranche of a payout of US$80,300 together with profits became due in May 2012, both told him SMLG was unable to pay because of a technical glitch in the algorithm. In September 2012, both advised Mr Saimee, 47, to ink settlement pacts with SMLG for the return of US$711,000, comprising the invested sum and promised returns - but the deals were not kept. In July last year, he sued both, through lawyers Uthayasurian Sidambaram and Aditya Naidu, for negligent misrepresentation, and IPP for vicarious liability, among other things. His lawyers argued that both owed a duty of care as they had advised Mr Saimee in their professional capacity as financial advisers. Lawyers for the duo led by Mr Wilson Tan denied the claims, arguing that the SMLG investment was merely personal advice and Mr Saimee was an experienced investor. Mr Dominic Chan, defending IPP, argued that Mr Saimee ought to have known such advice was neither official nor professional. Justice Choo, in rejecting the claims, found the duo had breached the duty of care to Mr Saimee. He said IPP also had to bear vicarious responsibility when financial harm occurred, since it engaged the financial advisers to sell its financial products and thereby created the risk of such advisers committing wrongs against third parties. Mr Saimee's lawyer, Mr Naidu, said: ""The decision has provided closure and justice for our client, who had to go through this ordeal for more than six years."" IPP Financial Advisers said yesterday the ""case is about representatives acting outside their scope of professional duty and giving personal advice without the knowledge of the company, for a product which was never approved by the company. ""We would like to reiterate that we have never been in the space of providing advice on forex trading."" "

Singaporean Parvis Ahamed Mohamed Ghouse, 42, and his company, Labourtel Management Corporation, face the first charges to be brought under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act, which took effect in January 2016. They are accused of failing to comply with licensing conditions between November 2017 and January this year. Labourtel, which comes under property and logistics solutions company MES Group, allegedly committed offences such as failing to maintain the cleanliness of the dormitories. Parvis is accused of neglect. Labourtel was charged with 10 counts of offences under the Act, while Parvis was handed six charges. Two of the facilities - Jurong Penjuru Dormitory 1 and 2 - are located in Penjuru Place near West Coast Road. The other two are Blue Stars Dormitory near Boon Lay Way and The Leo in Kaki Bukit Road 3. The Ministry of Manpower, which carried out the checks, said: ""Investigations revealed that the (dormitories) were poorly maintained. For example, there were missing or damaged light fixtures, faulty shower taps and corroded railings and staircases. ""The living conditions in (them) were also filthy and unacceptable, such as cockroaches found in the rooms."" According to court documents, inspectors found missing rubbish chute covers and toilet doors at Jurong Penjuru Dormitory 2, while stoves and washing basins were found to be damaged at Blue Stars Dormitory. The cases have been adjourned until Aug 1. If convicted, the company can be fined up to $50,000 for each charge. Parvis, meanwhile, could face up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $50,000 for each charge if convicted. "

As Madam Choong Pei Shan struggled for her life, he allegedly told her: ""Shan, you got to let go already, I owe a lot of money. If you struggle, you will suffer."" After making sure she was dead, Teo is believed to have asked his four-year-old daughter to sit on his lap. ""Don't be scared, Papa is here,"" he told her. The girl cried as he allegedly tightened the towel around her neck. ""Go find your mummy first. Papa will come soon,"" he told her. Teo's chilling account of how he allegedly killed his wife and child, told to Dr Derrick Yeo of the Institute of Mental Health, emerged in court when the psychiatrist took the stand yesterday, the third day of Teo's murder trial. The 43-year-old faces two counts of murder for strangling Madam Choong, 39, and the couple's daughter, Zi Ning, at their Woodlands flat on Jan 20, 2017. Teo is said to have spent a week in the flat with the bodies and burned them before the deaths were discovered on Jan 28, 2017 - the first day of Chinese New Year - after Madam Choong's family called the police. Dr Yeo, who saw Teo six times and interviewed his family members and co-workers, concluded that the former property agent was not suffering from any mental disorder when he allegedly committed the murders. The psychiatrist said Teo's behaviour was logical, goal-directed and showed planning. On the morning of Jan 20, 2017, Teo and Madam Choong quarrelled after she questioned why he had changed Zi Ning out of her school uniform. CONSCIOUS DECISION <strong>He was able to make objective choices and consider alternatives to his behaviour. His action to kill his wife was not something that was out of his control.</strong> DR DERRICK YEO of the Institute of Mental Health, on suspect Teo Ghim Heng. When Teo said Zi Ning could be chased out of school as he had not paid her fees for two months, Madam Choong mocked him in front of their daughter, he said. Teo said he was angered when his wife called him useless, and told her that she should not have married him. He allegedly went to the bathroom to get a towel, looped it around his wife's neck and pulled. Three minutes in, he decided to kill her and their daughter, and then commit suicide to ""reunite the family"". Teo, who was mired in debt, told Dr Yeo that he decided to end all their lives because he did not want them to be hounded by creditors. Dr Yeo said: ""He was able to make objective choices and consider alternatives to his behaviour. His action to kill his wife was not something that was out of his control."" The psychiatrist said that when Teo told his wife to ""let go"", he was trying to convince her, and justify to himself, that ending their lives was the correct decision. Teo also told Dr Yeo that he had killed Zi Ning because he reasoned that nobody else could give her the same level of care that he and his wife had. After allegedly killing his wife and daughter, Teo tried to slash his wrist, but the cut was superficial. He also downed Panadol tablets and drank diluted insecticide. Dr Yeo said: ""He wanted to die on his own terms. Many of the attempts were either too painful, too difficult or not successful."" This showed Teo was in full cognisant control of his actions, he added. Teo wrote four suicide notes, including instructions for his wife's mobile phone - which contained photos and videos of Zi Ning - to be handed over to the girl's grandparents, as well as instructions for the division of the couple's assets. This showed planning and forward thinking, said Dr Yeo. The court also heard that days after he was arrested for the double murder, Teo told a Changi General Hospital (CGH) psychiatrist that he had ""no regrets"". But Teo, who was treated at CGH for Panadol overdose, added that his only regret was that he had to take the life of his innocent young daughter. The trial continues today. "

He then made more unauthorised trades and transactions to recover and replace the sum, but ended up with extra losses of at least US$10 million. Kale Jagdish Purushottam, 43, was sentenced to 13 years' jail yesterday, after he pleaded guilty to 20 forgery and cheating-related charges, and another 30 charges under the Computer Misuse Act. Another 503 similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The offences were committed between June 2010 and January 2013, when Kale was a private banker with Barclays Bank. Prior to joining the British bank in February 2010, Kale worked for UBS Singapore where he was the relationship manager for a company called Red Oak, which alleged that Kale had engaged in unauthorised foreign exchange transactions using the money in its account. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jean Ting said Kale agreed to pay Red Oak $14 million to avoid a legal case. However, he paid the firm with money from his Barclays clients' bank accounts instead. He forged payment instructions and signatures to illegally transfer about US$10 million to Red Oak from bank accounts maintained by three clients. DPP Ng told the court that Kale passed off the forged documents by copying and pasting the genuine signatures of authorised signatories into his own Word documents. To cover up the shortfall in the bank accounts of his three clients, he forged more documents to move monies between his other clients' accounts. He also forged documents to create accounts in his clients' names that would allow him to take up loans. These loaned sums were then transferred to Red Oak, or used to cover up the other unauthorised fund transfers, said DPP Ng. To cover up the loss of his clients' monies, Kale tried to make money through unauthorised stock and foreign exchange transactions using his clients' accounts, she added. ""However, the unauthorised trades and other transactions caused further net losses of at least US$10 million to Barclays,"" said DPP Ng. On Feb 1, 2013, the Commercial Affairs Department received information that Kale might have forged his clients' signatures. He was sacked that same month. In mitigation, defence counsel Anand Nalachandran told the court that Kale had not made the transfers or trades for personal financial benefit, but to satisfy what he thought was an obligation. ""Having just moved to Barclays, he was faced with allegations (from Red Oak), and instead of heeding advice, he'd rather acted rashly and then did these things to satisfy his obligation,"" said Mr Anand. But District Judge Ong Hian Sun pointed out that there was a ""grave breach of trust"" on Kale's end. According to court documents, Barclays managed to recover US$4 million after a settlement with Red Oak and Kale made restitution of $400,000 to the bank. "

Syed Maffi Hasan lifted part-time waitress Atika Dolkifli, 23, and threw her over the parapet of Deck 5A of the carpark in Toa Payoh Lorong 2 on the night of Aug 31, 2015. In May this year, he was convicted of murder with the intention of causing bodily injury that was likely to cause death, after giving up his fight against the charge. During his trial, the High Court heard that the two got to know each other on Facebook in 2013, and reconnected in April 2015. Ms Atika lent Syed Maffi, who was jobless, her spare phone in May 2015 as he did not have one. The iPhone 5C later became faulty and he spent about $125 on repairs. But he lied to her about the cost and sought reimbursement of $300. He turned up at her workplace many times, and also went to her home but was turned away by her father. Her older brother told Syed Maffi to keep the phone and warned him not to contact Ms Atika again. However, on Aug 31, 2015, Syed Maffi arranged to meet Ms Atika after her shift ended. Surveillance footage showed them entering the carpark at about 9.50pm and Syed Maffi leaving alone with her handbag at about 10.30pm. He admitted in court that they had argued over the repair costs on the top deck of the carpark. During the argument, he pushed Ms Atika, causing her to fall and hit the back of her head on a flight of stairs. He then dragged the semi-conscious woman down the remaining steps, grabbed her by her clothes and threw her over the parapet. He also took her phone and left her handbag inside a drain in Toa Payoh Lorong 1. Ms Atika's father lodged a missing person report on Sept 1. The next day, Syed Maffi lied to Ms Atika's brother that he last saw her walking towards the carpark. He later confessed to police that he had thrown her over the parapet. Yesterday, prosecutors sought a life term and at least 12 strokes of the cane. Deputy Public Prosecutor Bhajanvir Singh said Syed Maffi had persisted in hurting Ms Atika even after he saw that she was semi-conscious. Defence counsel Pratap Kishan asked for the ""least number of strokes"", saying that his client regrets his actions and has not wasted the court's time. "

Leong Sow Hon's offence was discovered after a portion of the incomplete viaduct gave way on July 14, 2017. The collapse resulted in the death of 31-year-old Chinese worker Chen Yinchuan. Ten other workers were injured in the incident. An investigation found that the permanent structures used in the viaduct's construction were so inadequate that they could have collapsed under the weight of a full traffic load and cause a large number of casualties. Leong, 61, who is also the managing director of Calibre Consulting Singapore, had been appointed by the Land Transport Authority as an accredited checker. On June 24, he pleaded guilty to failing to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations in accordance with regulations under the Building Control Act. One count of falsely certifying that he had carried out the required checks was considered during sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang had said that Leong's offences could have resulted in ""high potential harm"". The DPP told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim: ""Investigations have revealed that the permanent corbels were inadequately designed... Out of the 10 permanent corbels, eight of them were inadequately designed for the total load, including traffic, upon completion of the viaduct."" Of the eight, five of the corbels were unable to support the weight they were supposed to be designed for. The remaining three would have shown significant cracks with a full traffic load, leading to a collapse. Leong is so far the only person involved in the case to plead guilty. As the final checker, his job was to go through the detailed plans and design calculations for the permanent corbels. However, no calculations were performed for both permanent and temporary corbels during the submissions stage of building works. Yesterday, the court heard that Leong intends to appeal against his sentence, and was offered bail of $15,000. The cases involving the main contractor, Or Kim Peow Contractors, and four other men allegedly linked to the incident are still pending. They are: The qualified person from subcontractor CPG Consultants, Robert Arianto Tjandra, 46; project engineer Wong Kiew Hai, 31; and project director Allen Yee, 49 - both from Or Kim Peow Contractors - as well as its group managing director Or Toh Wat, 51.

Tan Sen Yang, 27, Loo Boon Chong, 25, and Tan Hong Sheng, 22, appeared via video link. The three, who are currently in remand at the Central Police Division in Cantonment Road, are each facing the same charge. The seven allegedly killed Mr Satheesh Noel Gobidass on Tuesday at around 6.25am at the entrance of Orchard Towers. According to court documents, they were ""members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt"" to Mr Satheesh. The accused persons displayed no emotion when the charges were read out to them in court. Only Chan was represented by a lawyer. More than 20 of their friends and relatives were in court to hear the case. The police had arrested eight people, including two women, by Tuesday evening for the murder. Investigations are ongoing on the last member of the group, the police said on Wednesday. The Straits Times had reported earlier that closed-circuit television footage from a shop on the first storey of the building showed Mr Satheesh exchanging blows with some individuals after he approached one of them. After the group of individuals left, Mr Satheesh stumbled in front of the building's glass doors. He appeared to be bleeding from his neck as bystanders tried to staunch the blood flow. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, but was pronounced dead at 7.25am. When ST arrived at the scene on Tuesday afternoon, there was a pool of blood as well as a lot of blood-soaked tissues at the building's entrance. The police were seen speaking to people at the Naughty Girl club, and most of the second floor and the building's main entrance were cordoned off. Storekeepers at Orchard Towers said they had heard shouting and fighting in the early morning, and believed the brawl had started on the second floor of Orchard Towers. The seven accused will be back in court on July 11, and have been remanded for investigation. No bail was extended as this is a capital offence. Offenders convicted of murder will face the death penalty. <strong>Correction note:</strong> "

One of the managers, Singaporean Pek Siew Gek, 42, was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail on Thursday after pleading guilty to two counts of giving false information to the authorities. The offences were related to false items - 10 examination scripts and six attendance lists. She had also admitted to one count of failing to comply with directions from the Council for Private Education (CPE), now known as the Committee for Private Education. Last year, Pek and another manager, Chinese national Tang Yudong, 30, were convicted of one count each of abetting to obstruct the course of justice. Pek and Tang were sentenced to three months and two months' jail respectively on July 27 last year. They appealed against the earlier conviction and sentence but these were dismissed on June 10 this year. Pek, who now has to spend a total of three months and 10 weeks behind bars, will serve her latest sentence after completing the first one. On Thursday, Tang, who is a Singapore permanent resident, was jailed for four weeks for failing to comply with directions from the CPE. This means he will serve a total of two months and four weeks behind bars. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim that each student had paid the school between $717 and $6,923 for their courses. Most of them signed up for a diploma course in maritime studies, while others were enrolled in other courses. Graduates of the maritime course usually work as bunker surveyors. KIBS' offences came to light in 2014 after the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore told the CPE that the school had offered the maritime studies diploma to students who did not attend classes. Pek and Tang were later told by the authorities to refund more than $170,000 to students who had not completed their studies as of April 20, 2015. The 34 students were supposed to receive their full refund by July 3 that year. The pair were also ordered to make arrangements for each student to be offered a place in another registered private education institution by May 5, 2015. But they failed to comply with these directions from the CPE and so far, only about $30,350 of the course fees had been refunded. The students received their payments as late as Aug 4, 2016. Pek and Tang also did not make any arrangements for the students to be offered places in other schools. The CPE was appointed by the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) Board in 2016 to carry out its functions and powers relating to private education under the Private Education Act. In a statement on Thursday, SSG's group director of regulation, fraud and enforcement Hui Mei San said: ""Members of the public should be cautious and not take up offers for certifications that do not require them to attend classes... and we would advise them to raise such cases to our attention.""

Leong, 61, who is also the managing director of Calibre Consulting Singapore, had been appointed by the Land Transport Authority as an accredited checker. On June 24, he pleaded guilty to failing to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations in accordance with regulations under the Building Control Act. One count of falsely certifying that he had carried out the required checks was considered during sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang said that Leong's offences could have resulted in ""high potential harm"". The DPP told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim: ""Investigations have revealed that the permanent corbels were inadequately designed... Out of the 10 permanent corbels, eight of them were inadequately designed for the total load, including traffic, upon completion of the viaduct."" Of the eight, five of the corbels were unable to support the weight they were supposed to be designed for. The remaining three would have shown significant cracks with a full traffic load, leading to a collapse. DPP Yang added: ""If the viaduct collapsed after it had been constructed and opened to traffic, the casualties caused would be unimaginable."" Leong is so far the only person involved in the case to plead guilty. As the final checker, Leong's job was to go through the detailed plans and design calculations for the permanent corbels. However, no calculations were performed for both permanent and temporary corbels during the submissions stage of building works. On Thursday, the court heard that Leong intends to appeal against his sentence and was offered bail of $15,000.

On Tuesday, the police said they received a report from a telecommunications company regarding several charge-back requests it had received from banks between May 22 and June 18. A charge-back is a reversal of a credit card transaction. The Straits Times understands the telco is not one of the three major firms - M1, Singtel or StarHub. The requests were related to unauthorised transactions made using different credit cards to purchase mobile subscription plans, including the delivery of four mobile phones worth at least $2,600.

He reoffended while on probation and was sentenced to reformative training in 2015. He was sent to a reformative training centre (RTC) to follow a strict regimen, but absconded from his day-release scheme last year. While on the run, he and two accomplices - Mohammad Faris Mohammad Fadzir, 17, and Jamal Razeen Abdul Ghani, 19 - went to Little India at around 2am on March 11 last year. Jamal and Faris acted as lookouts while Saatish used a blowtorch to cut the hinges of the rear door of Merlin Goldsmith and Jewellery in Serangoon Road. They left after Faris spotted a man observing Saatish. They returned to Little India later that morning and Saatish used the blowtorch to dismantle the roller shutters of Jewel Palace in Buffalo Road.

Chinese nationals Tang Bei and Tang Lei, 51, claimed that they had been provoked into committing the offences. They also argued that they were the real victims and were being treated unfairly because of their nationality. But High Court judge Aedit Abdullah stressed that the courts in Singapore determine matters equally for all offenders, regardless of nationality, ethnicity or religion. In this case, there was no grave and sudden provocation that would clear the sisters of the charges, he said. As for their grievances that others involved were not prosecuted, the judge said the court could deal only with the charges before it. Last year, a district judge fined Tang Bei $2,100 and Tang Lei $2,500 after a 20-day trial. The incident on April 28, 2015, was caught on video and went viral. Tang Bei was convicted of causing hurt to and spitting on condominium manager Colvin Quek Choon Kiat, and causing hurt to security officer Charles Bligh. Tang Lei was convicted of causing hurt to Mr Quek as well as spitting at and splashing a drink on him, and causing hurt to Mr Bligh. The sisters assaulted and spat on Mr Quek when a meeting at the condominium's management office over an access card turned ugly. Tang Lei also threw the contents of her canned drink at Mr Quek, who - having had previous encounters with Tang Bei - decided to film the meeting with his mobile phone. The women attacked Mr Bligh when he stepped into the office. Mr Quek was later treated for bruises and abrasions. Yesterday, Tang Lei argued that the video could not prove there was physical contact, as it had been taken from one angle and there could be optical illusions. Tang Bei claimed that Mr Quek was the real instigator who had taunted her verbally before the video recording started. She also alleged that he had molested her on a previous occasion and that she was exercising her ""basic right to react"". "

That was the last thing Madam Choong Pei Shan, 39, said to their four-year-old daughter, before the woman and the girl were strangled, the High Court heard yesterday. Teo's account of an argument that transpired on the morning of Jan 20, 2017, shortly before he allegedly murdered his wife and daughter, emerged on the second day of his trial. After the alleged double murder, he is said to have spent a week in the Woodlands flat and burned their bodies. The deaths were discovered on Jan 28, the first day of Chinese New Year, after Madam Choong's family called the police. In a statement to the police after his arrest, Teo said that on the morning of Jan 20, his wife had questioned why their daughter was not going to school, after Madam Choong saw that he had changed Zi Ning out of her school uniform. The former property agent said he told his wife that he did not have money to pay the girl's school fees, and if the girl went to school, it would be embarrassing if she were told to leave. He said Madam Choong then chided him, saying: ""Other families can take care of three kids, you can't even provide for a family with one child. You're so useless."" Teo said he ""tuned out"" her nagging at one point but remembered that she used ""very sarcastic and hurtful words"" and he remembered anger slowly building inside him. The statement was read out by Teo's defence lawyer, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam, when Madam Choong's brother Gordon was on the stand. Earlier, Mr Choong had described his sister as a ""soft"" and ""kind"" person who did not engage others in quarrels. He agreed when Mr Thuraisingam asked if it was unusual for his sister to say such words as described by Teo. Most of the proceedings yesterday dwelt on Teo's financial difficulties. The former principal of the Little Tree House childcare centre that Zi Ning attended, Ms Faizahhanimi Ahmad, testified that at the time of the killings, Teo owed fees for two months. She said Teo used to be prompt in payment, but from mid-2016, he was either late or defaulted on paying the monthly fees of $850. She told the court that in January 2017, Teo told her not to talk about school fees in front of Madam Choong as his wife was ""pregnant and emotional"". Ms Faizahhanimi said the couple usually dropped off and picked up Zi Ning together, but on the evening of Jan 19, Teo came alone. Four former colleagues of Teo were also called by the prosecution to testify that he had borrowed large sums of money from them or requested for salary advances. They also talked about his gambling habit, saying that he could lose as much as $2,000 during a mahjong session and had placed bets of as much as $700 a week on 4-D. However, they said Teo loved his wife and daughter very much. Teo's supervisor at a renovation company where he was a sales coordinator said the accused requested to leave the office daily at 4.30pm to pick up Zi Ning and buy dinner for his family, before returning to work. The boss, Husniyati Omar, who is currently serving a sentence for a renovation scam, testified in her prison uniform. Teo's mother and brother also took the stand, saying that he did not tell them of any financial problems. As for his wife's family, Mr Choong told the court that his parents have been suffering after the incident. ""Every year, Chinese New Year to us is a torture,"" he said in court. The trial continues.

The requests were related to unauthorised transactions made using different credit cards to purchase mobile subscription plans, including the delivery of four mobile phones worth at least $2,600. After investigations and ground inquiries, Tanglin Police Division officers established the identity of the 32-year-old suspect and arrested him on the same day. A mobile phone was seized. The man is believed to be involved in other similar cases, the police said. Those found guilty of unauthorised access to computer material can be fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to two years, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined not exceeding $10,000 and jailed up to three years, or both. In its statement, the police advised credit and debit card holders to opt for SMS one-time password (OTP) verification for charges made to their cards. ""Check the bank statements and alert the bank immediately should there be any discrepancies or fraudulent charges,"" the police said. "

Neither the identity nor the rank of the officer was revealed. Interpol's executive director of police services Tim Morris told the media yesterday on the sidelines of the Interpol World conference that these regional nodes are important. ""The police officers from the region know the region best. Interpol needs to use their expertise, knowledge and experience, not only to help the fight against terrorism within the region, but also (to find out) how it impacts other regions around the world, whether it be Europe, West or East Africa, or even Latin America,"" he said. Interpol has established similar counter-terrorism nodes in East Africa and West Africa. Mr Morris said Singapore was chosen as the site of the Asia-Pacific RCTN because it is an important security hub in the region, adding that the agency and the Singapore Government have invested ""substantial capital"" to set up the Interpol Global Complex for Innovation, which provides Interpol with the infrastructure to allow it to execute its functions. The Asia-Pacific team will start with six officers, including the SPF representative. Each officer is skilled in various aspects of fighting terrorism. The team will have access to the 18 Interpol databases that provide, for example, information on foreign terrorist fighters, the social media platforms that terrorists use, and their travel patterns and modes of transport. ""Interpol believes such a network is important if police forces around the world are going to be connected in an effective way to fight terrorism,"" said Mr Morris. The three-day Interpol World conference is being held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands. It brings together law enforcement agencies, government bodies, academics and industry players to discuss challenges and solutions in areas such as cybercrime, drones and big data. Speaking at the opening ceremony yesterday, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo said crime and terrorism are increasingly borderless and inventive. Therefore, law-enforcement agencies in different countries must work together more by sharing information more quickly and pooling resources to coordinate transnational responses. She highlighted three key developments currently reshaping the global security landscape. First, everyone is now better connected and, while that brings about economic opportunities, Mrs Teo said it also has implications for border security and transnational crime. The advancement of technology is the second key development. ""It is being misused to steal data, incapacitate systems, spread false information and evoke negative sentiments against others,"" she said. Mrs Teo said the most worrying development is the polarisation in societies. While divergent views on politics and religion have always existed, extremists these days have the tools to spread their message to a wider audience at a very low cost. ""The result is self-radicalisation, a previously unheard of phenomenon. In this new landscape, otherwise ordinary citizens can become explosive nodes of destruction, without anyone noticing,"" Mrs Teo added. "

It was told that Teo slept on the same bed as the bodies for a week in his Woodlands flat, with the air conditioner turned on to delay decomposition. He searched the Internet for ways to commit suicide, leaving the flat only to buy food and air freshener. Then he allegedly set the bodies on fire, claiming he also tried to kill himself in the blaze but aborted the attempt as it was too hot. The court also heard that he gave excuses when his wife's family asked about her whereabouts, and they eventually called the police on the first day of Chinese New Year. The details surrounding the tragic deaths of Teo's wife, Choong Pei Shan, 39, her daughter Zi Ning, and an unborn son, emerged yesterday as prosecutors set out their case against him for a double murder on the first day of his trial. Teo, 43, is charged with two counts of murder for killing his wife and daughter on Jan 20, 2017 with the intention of causing death, which carries the mandatory death penalty. A third charge of killing his unborn son has been stood down for now. The couple married in 2009, and it was the second marriage for both. The High Court heard that Teo was an avid gambler who racked up debts of at least $120,000 at the end of 2016, but kept his wife in the dark about the extent of his debts. He listed the flat for sale and took on another job as a sales coordinator. ""The accused felt Pei Shan should have contributed to the household income by working. He also never fully forgave her for an affair she had a few years back, and strongly suspected that Zi Ning was not his biological daughter,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Han Ming Kuang.

He also never fully forgave her for an affair she had a few years back, and strongly suspected that Zi Ning was not his biological daughter.</strong> DEPUTY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR HAN MING KUANG. The High Court heard that Teo Ghim Heng was an avid gambler who racked up debts of at least $120,000 at the end of 2016, but kept his wife in the dark about the extent of his debts. According to Teo's statements to the police, he and Madam Choong, a housewife, had an argument on Jan 18, 2017. He told her he owed a total of $70,000 and could not pay their daughter's kindergarten fees. Two days later, the couple argued about money again while in the master bedroom. Teo told the police that he looped a towel around Madam Choong's neck and pulled both ends for about 15 minutes. He then strangled her with his bare hands until she stopped breathing. He claimed that his daughter, who had changed for kindergarten, was in the master bedroom throughout playing with her toys and watching TV. Teo then strangled his daughter. Teo said he tried various means to take his own life after killing his wife and daughter. This included setting fire to their bodies, then lying on the bed next to them. On Jan 23, three days after the killings, three of Teo's colleagues went to his flat to look for him as he had not shown up for work. They included Husniyati Omar and her husband Aszrul Mohd Yusoff, who have been jailed for a $1.6 million renovation scam. Teo refused to leave the flat even after a third colleague tripped the main power switch outside to force him to open the door. He also repeatedly lied to his family and his wife's family to explain their absence at Chinese New Year gatherings. He told them that Madam Choong was ill and used her phone to communicate with her family members and Zi Ning's teachers. On Jan 28, the first day of Chinese New Year, Madam Choong's brother Gordon knocked on the door but got no response. That same day, Teo used a payphone at the void deck to call his mother-in-law and mother, lying that his wife had kicked him out of the flat, Deputy Public Prosecutor Dillon Kok told the court. Madam Choong's family became suspicious and returned to the flat. When Mr Choong detected a pungent odour after forcing open a window, he called the police. Just as firefighters were about to force their way in, Teo opened the door. As Mr Choong shouted at him, Teo calmly told him Madam Choong was dead. <figure class=""image file-media-original media-element""><img alt="""" delta=""1"" element=""1"" fid=""771252"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/2019/07/02/murder31.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" width=""780""/><br/><figcaption>Police officers taking away Teo Ghim Heng, who is believed to be the dead woman's husband, in connection with the deaths.

He repeated this to the police the next day, but later admitted that he had strangled his wife and daughter. Teo also showed police four suicide notes that he claimed were written by his wife and himself. A handwriting analysis concluded, after comparing the notes with 40 samples of Teo's handwriting, that these were probably written by him.

Employees arriving for work yesterday morning were shocked to see the 31-year-old victim on the ground at the building's entrance in a pool of blood. Earlier, those in the building had heard people shouting and fighting. Closed-circuit television footage from a shop on the first floor showed a group of about 10 men and women walking towards the victim and striking him after he stepped off an escalator and approached one of them. The victim exchanged several blows with members of the group, and was later cornered by them. The group subsequently left, and the man fell in front of the building's glass doors. He seemed to be bleeding from his neck, according to footage seen by The Straits Times. The man was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7.25am. When The Straits Times arrived at the scene at about 11am, the police, who had been alerted at 6.25am, were seen gathering evidence, including a mound of blood-soaked tissue, near the building's cordoned-off entrance. At 1pm, most of the building's second floor and main entrance still remained out of bounds for investigations. Police officers were seen speaking to people at the Naughty Girl Club on the same floor. In a statement yesterday evening, the police said eight suspects between the ages of 22 and 27 were identified and arrested within 12 hours. Four of the men and one woman were expected to be charged with murder with common intention tomorrow, according to the statement, which said investigations were still ongoing regarding the rest. A murder conviction could result in the death penalty. Mr Muhammad Bilel, 40, who works at a convenience store on the first floor, said his colleague who was on the early morning shift had heard a commotion outside the store. ""He heard a lot of people shouting and fighting, but he couldn't go out because he had to look after the shop,"" said Mr Bilel. Another store owner, who requested not to be named, said her workers had called her in panic at around 7am. ""They were all so scared. When they arrived, they saw someone lying on the floor outside the building's entrance,"" she said. She added that the fight had reportedly started inside Naughty Girl Club, but the group had continued fighting on the first floor. An employee of May Tailor and Alteration said footage of the incident has been circulating among the building's tenants. ""Someone took a video of the paramedics trying to save the man, and I could see there was blood all around his body,"" she said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Investigations and Intelligence) Florence Chua commended the officers for their work. ""The police are committed to keeping Singapore safe and we will spare no effort to track down offenders to ensure that they are brought swiftly to justice and face the full brunt of the law,"" said DCP Chua, who is also the Criminal Investigation Department chief.

They waited around jewellery stores in Singapore and negotiated to buy invoices from actual customers. Working with employees of the same jewellery store, these men would then obtain the eTRS refund ticket issued by the retailer to collect goods and services tax (GST) refunds at the airport. Investigations showed the syndicate made more than $167,000 in fraudulent GST tourist refund claims. On Tuesday (July 2), four men who worked for Abiraame Jewellers in Little India were sentenced for their role in the scam. Shanmugam Sampathkumar, 33; Murugesan Saravanan, 42; and 49-year-old Arumugam Chelladurai are Indian nationals. The fourth employee - Pang Wei Koon, 46 - is from Malaysia. Arumugam, who is also a Singapore permanent resident, was fined $12,000 after pleading guilty to eight charges under the GST (General) Regulations. Pang was fined $1,500 after pleading guilty to one charge while Shanmugam, who pleaded guilty to two, was fined $3,000. District Judge Adam Nakhoda sentenced Murugesan to a fine of $6,000 after he admitted to four charges. Each man was linked to between $600.56 and $5,265.73 in claims. Court documents did not state if all four men, who committed the offences in 2015 and 2016, are still working for Abiraame Jewellers. The syndicate members - Kothandaraman Gnanam, 29; Karunanidhi Rajesh, 32; Ramaiyan Karthikeyan, 44; and 61-year-old Waithiyalingam Karunanidhi - were sent to jail in 2017. By the time these four men were caught, they had removed from Singapore benefits of their criminal conduct totalling $112,924. Tax prosecutor Rajiv Rai, from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras), told the court on Tuesday that the eTRS process begins when a tourist buys an item from a participating GST-registered retailer. To make a GST refund claim under the scheme, the tourist must have items including the invoice of the goods purchased and the eTRS refund ticket issued by the retailer. The tourist can then obtain the GST refund at the airport after using either the eTRS self-help kiosk or by approaching a Singapore Customs officer at an inspection counter. Describing how the scam was carried out, Mr Rai said the claimants would loiter in and around jewellery stores to try to obtain invoices from actual customers. He added: ""Once a customer agreed to sell or give the invoice, a claimant would give his passport and embarkation card... to an employee of (Abiraame Jewellers) for the purposes of making an application for a GST refund under the claimant's passport number. ""The employee would enter the details of the claimant and the jewellery purchased into the eTRS system."" The employee would then print an eTRS refund ticket for the claimant to unlawfully obtain at the airport GST refunds which they were not entitled to. In a statement on Tuesday, Iras said that it will ""not hesitate to take stern enforcement actions against any individuals who commit the offence of wilful intent to make a false GST refund claim or, assist any other person to make false claims"". It added: ""Iras will also not hesitate to take firm action against retailers who are complicit or negligent in the issuing of eTRS tickets leading to the abuse of the Tourist Refund Scheme."" The cases involving three other men, who also worked at Abiraame Jewellers, are still pending. They are Singaporean Palaniappan Ramanathan, 41, and Indian nationals Manickavasagam Saravanan, also 41, and Kulamani Ganesan, 31. Those convicted of the offence under the GST (General) Regulations can be fined up to $5,000 for each charge. "

The 33-year-old Malaysian, who was working in a wholesale company, headed to Liang Court to transfer $1,200 on the instruction of an ""official"" from China, and was about to do so when two police officers at the mall noticed his frantic demeanour and approached him. Luckily, their intervention prevented him from becoming another victim of ""Chinese official"" scams and losing the money. Figures released by the police on Monday (July 1) showed that there were 65 such cases in Singapore between January and April involving at least $4.8 million, prompting the police to say that the Chinese official scam was making a return. Just over $48,000 of this total was lost in scams involving bitcoin machines, which police said are gaining traction as vehicles for fraudsters. Most of the victims - such as Mr Soh, whose full name was not given - were Chinese. ""Mr Soh was behaving in a very panicky manner,"" said Mr Chang Lian Seng, the deputy in charge of Orchard NPC community policing unit. ""After withdrawing money, he rushed to the bitcoin machine; that was a telltale sign."" Speaking in Mandarin, Mr Soh said that in future, he would ""first verify if such a thing actually happened before making a decision"". Others have not been as lucky as Mr Soh. Last year, a Chinese student in Singapore lost her entire savings of $22,500 when she provided her one-time password and access to her bank account to a scammer. In 2017, a woman lost $5.4 million after she was led to believe she had to surrender all her money to ""Chinese officials"" to assist in investigations. In their advisory on Monday, the police said that the Chinese official scams typically involve scammers who claim to be employees of courier companies or officers from government organisations. They would tell victims that either a mobile number registered in their name was involved in a crime, a parcel under their name containing illegal goods had been detained, there was a pending court case against them or they had committed a criminal offence and were required to assist in investigations. Scammers would ask the victims who received the calls to provide their personal details and bank account information, such as Internet banking credentials and one-time passwords for investigation purposes. In some of these cases, the call would be transferred to another person claiming to be a police officer from China. Victims may be shown a copy of a warrant for their arrest from the Chinese police and could be threatened with imprisonment if they did not cooperate. The victims then find out that money was transferred from their bank accounts to unknown accounts. There is also a variant of the scam, which involves scammers instructing victims to scan a QR code at bitcoin vending machines and transfer a sum of money using the machines.

Her flatmate led Theophileous into a room where he whipped out a fruit knife, pointed it at her and demanded cash. After searching the room, he took from her $100 in cash. He left the room soon after and told his accomplices to look for valuables. It is not known if they found any. The teenagers then fled the scene and the 36-year-old woman made a police report on Sept 9.

Prosecutors had appealed for a jail term to be meted out to Albert Tan Seo Whatt, 54, who had come up with the concept of selling ""memberships"" to investors by offering a gold bar upfront. Tan was originally sentenced to a $600,000 fine by a district court last year after he pleaded guilty to 20 charges of offering securities to investors without a prospectus through Gold Insignia, a company he managed. The case represents the first prosecution for the offence under the Securities and Futures Act. Three others on Gold Insignia's management team have been sentenced to fines of between $30,000 and $60,000 for their respective roles. Gold Insignia sold memberships priced between $5,000 and $1 million, promising investors regular payouts. Initially, the payouts were offered at 18 per cent per annum, but this was later adjusted to 12 per cent per annum. About 70 per cent of the membership fee was used to buy gold bars of between 50g and 10kg for investors to hold as collateral. Investors who terminate their memberships could either keep the gold and stop receiving payouts, or return the gold and get a full refund of the fee. Between June 2010 and November 2011, Gold Insignia sold 853 memberships to 547 investors, raising nearly $30 million. During this period, Tan paid himself $431,000. After Gold Insignia was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Investor Alert List in March 2011, another company called Insignia9 was set up to continue the business. In written submissions arguing for Tan to be jailed, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Khoo said Gold Insignia's business was essentially a money circulation scheme in which old investors were being paid from money raised from new investors. The lack of a prospectus was central to successfully attracting investors to such an unsustainable scheme, he said. ""The investing public was prevented from discovering that the 'investment' was simply a money circulation scheme without any special investment strategy to generate 92 per cent to 112 per cent returns on monies collected,"" said the DPP. He argued that the district judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the markedly different role that Tan played compared to the other three. On Friday, High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng agreed with the prosecution that Tan should be jailed. Justice Hoo noted that Tan's role was substantial and he had benefited from the scheme. While there was no evidence of actual loss, significant sums belonging to multiple investors were exposed to loss, she said. She also dismissed Tan's appeal for a lower fine. "

The Singaporean woman struggled and swung her arms around, smacking the left hand of another policeman, 21-year-old Sergeant Chng Yong En. She was arrested after more police officers arrived at the scene. Resshmi, 21, pleaded guilty to one count of assaulting Station Insp Chan and was jailed for three months yesterday. One count of using criminal force on Sgt Chng was considered during sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Zhi Hao said that at around 10am on Oct 27 last year, the police received a call about a commotion in front of a club in the Orchard Road shopping mall. Station Insp Chan and Sgt Chng arrived at the scene and saw a scuffle involving a group of at least six people, including Resshmi. The policemen managed to defuse the situation and were trying to find out more about it when a man from the group suddenly ran into a nearby toilet. The other people, including Resshmi, followed him inside and the officers called for backup as they did not want to lose control of the situation. DPP Tan said the group became increasingly rowdy and the two officers blocked the door of the toilet to stop them from leaving. When the officers attempted again to establish the facts of the incident, ""the group refused to comply and tried to push their way out of the toilet"", said DPP Tan.

Ng Leok Soon, 66, was jailed a year and seven months yesterday after pleading guilty to two counts of being part of a conspiracy in 2012 to commit cheating. Court documents did not state why Ng, who was operating a coffee stall then, was dealt with only this year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Rebecca Wong said that in September 2012, Ng was heavily in debt and wanted to borrow a large amount of cash when he approached his friend Alvin Chua Yuen Shen, 46. Mr Chua, who was at the time working as a customer acquisition officer for sales solutions firm eFusion Solutions, told Ng that he would get someone to secure bank loans for him. But in return, Ng would have to give the third party 20 per cent of the loan amount. Ng agreed as he knew that he would not be able to obtain personal bank loans with his job at the time. On Sept 17 that year, Ng met Mr Chua at his eFusion Solutions office, where the younger man gave him payslips purportedly from CGGVeritas Services Singapore, a provider of geophysical services and equipment. The fake payslips showed Ng earning about $20,000 a month. Mr Chua then told his colleague, Mr Toh Hong Guan, 44, that he had a walk-in customer who wanted to apply for a loan from OCBC Bank. Mr Toh looked at the payslips and told him he could receive a maximum loan of $82,000. Mr Toh then filled up a loan application before passing it to Ng, so he could verify and sign it. OCBC received the application the next day and approved the loan. On Sept 21, 2012, Ng withdrew $81,000 in cash and handed $16,000 to Mr Chua. Using a similar method, Ng duped HSBC into approving a loan for $83,000. A few days later, on Sept 24, he withdrew $60,000 in cash from HSBC and gave Mr Chua $16,000. The offences came to light when an OCBC staff member conducted a check with CGGVeritas Services Singapore, now known as CGG Services Singapore, and discovered Ng was not working there. The police were notified on Oct 4 that year. HSBC froze Ng's account and retained the balance of almost $23,000 of the personal loan when it discovered the fraud. DPP Wong told District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt: ""The accused used the monies he obtained from the loans to repay (loans from unlicensed moneylenders) and friends. He also used the money to buy an iPad for online betting."" Ng caused the two banks to lose $141,000 in total. To date, he has made no restitution and Mr Chua has not been dealt with in court. "

Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang told the court yesterday that 61-year-old engineer Leong Sow Hon, who was appointed by the Land Transport Authority as an accredited checker, had failed to go through the detailed plans and design calculations for permanent corbels, or support structures. Permanent corbels are reinforced concrete structures that are critical in the stability of a viaduct. They allow the load on a flyover to be transferred to the columns. Leong's deceit could have resulted in ""high potential harm"", said DPP Yang. ""Investigations have revealed that the permanent corbels were inadequately designed... out of the 10 permanent corbels, eight of them were inadequately designed for the total load, including traffic, upon completion of the viaduct."" Of the eight, five of the corbels were unable to support the weight they were supposed to be designed for. The remaining three, said DPP Yang, would have shown significant cracks with a full traffic load, leading to a collapse. ""If the viaduct collapsed after it had been constructed and opened to traffic, the casualties caused would be unimaginable,"" the DPP added. Leong, the managing director of Calibre Consulting Singapore, pleaded guilty yesterday to failing to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations of the viaduct building works in accordance with regulations under the Building Control Act. One count of falsely certifying that he had carried out the required checks will be taken into consideration during sentencing. Leong is so far the only person involved in the case to plead guilty. His actions were discovered only after temporary structures at the incomplete viaduct gave way on July 14, 2017. The collapse resulted in the death of 31-year-old Chinese worker Chen Yinchuan. Ten other workers were injured in the incident. As the final checker, Leong's job was to go through the detailed plans and design calculations for the permanent corbels. But he admitted to not evaluating, analysing or reviewing the structural design in the plans and failing to perform original calculations for all permanent corbels. Although he initially claimed he had performed the original calculations for the corbels and found them to be adequate, Leong was unable to provide evidence. In fact, no calculations were performed for both permanent and temporary corbels during the submissions stage of building works. The cases involving the main contractor, Or Kim Peow Contractors, and four other men allegedly linked to the incident are still pending. They are the qualified person from subcontractor CPG Consultants, Robert Arianto Tjandra, 46; project engineer Wong Kiew Hai, 31; and project director Allen Yee, 49 - both from Or Kim Peow Contractors - as well as its group managing director Or Toh Wat, 51. Yesterday, DPP Yang urged District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim to sentence Leong to at least nine months in jail. He added: ""The seriousness of the harm risked, the likelihood of that harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm are all high."" Those convicted of the offence under the Act can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $100,000. Defence lawyer Lim Lian Kee pleaded for his client to be fined $25,000, adding that a jail sentence was not justified. Mr Lim also told the judge that the collapse in 2017 was caused by the temporary corbels, not the permanent ones. Or Kim Peow Contractors has been replaced by Hwa Seng Builder, which clinched the deal to complete the stalled project for $95.6 million last year. The viaduct was supposed to be completed by the first quarter of next year, but is now expected to be ready by the first half of 2022. Leong's case has been adjourned to July 5. "

Ng Leok Soon, 66, was jailed a year and seven months on Monday (June 24) after pleading guilty to two counts of being part of a conspiracy in 2012 to commit cheating. Court documents did not state why Ng, who was operating a coffee stall then, was dealt with only this year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Rebecca Wong said that in September 2012, Ng was heavily in debt and wanted to borrow a ""large amount"" of cash when he approached his friend Alvin Chua Yuen Shen, 46. Chua, who was at the time working as a customer acquisition officer for sales solutions firm eFusion Solutions, told Ng that he would get someone to secure bank loans for him. But in return, Ng would have to give the third party 20 per cent of the loan amount. Ng agreed with his friend's condition as he knew that he would not be able to obtain personal bank loans with the job he had at the time. On Sept 17 that year, Ng met Chua at his eFusion Solutions office where the younger man gave him payslips purportedly from CGGVeritas Services Singapore, a provider of geophysical services and equipment. The fake payslips showed Ng earning about $20,000 a month. Chua then told his colleague, Mr Toh Hong Guan, 44, that he had a walk-in customer who wanted to apply for a loan from OCBC Bank. Mr Toh looked at the payslips and told him he could receive a maximum loan of $82,000. Mr Toh then filled up a loan application before passing it to Ng so that he could verify and sign it. OCBC received the application the next day and approved the loan. On Sept 21, 2012, Ng withdrew $81,000 in cash and handed $16,000 to Chua. By using a similar method, Ng also duped HSBC into approving a loan for $83,000. On Sept 24 that year, he withdrew $60,000 in cash from HSBC and gave $16,000 to Chua. The offences came to light when an OCBC employee conducted a check with CGGVeritas Services Singapore, which is now known as CGG Services Singapore, and discovered he was not working there. The police were notified on Oct 4, 2012. DPP Wong told District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt: ""The accused used the monies he obtained from the loans to repay debts from 'Ah Longs' and friends and also used the money to buy an iPad for online betting."" Ng caused the two banks to lose $141,000 in total. To date, he has made no restitution and Chua has not been dealt with in court. For each count of being part of a conspiracy to commit cheating, Ng could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

In her findings, the State Coroner said that according to the teenager, her mother was unhappy that her father often worked late. The couple would then quarrel and threaten to divorce each other. In April last year, the woman told her daughter that the man had asked for a separation after an argument. The girl stated that following this incident, her father was insistent on a divorce as he did not want his wife to call him every day and wished that she would be more understanding about his work schedule. State Coroner Kamala said that the man's colleagues believed that he was intent on divorcing his wife and that he had contemplated moving to Canada to meet a friend whom he had met on an online gaming platform. The girl was sleeping in her room on May 1 last year when she was woken at around 5.30am by the sound of her father screaming.

The police had earlier advised her to stop communicating with the man, known as William Banch, but she continued helping him. The 48-year-old woman, who lost her job as a croupier during investigations, was sentenced on Wednesday to three years and four months in jail. The Singaporean pleaded guilty to three counts of dealing with the proceeds of criminal activities totalling nearly $230,000. Thirty-seven other charges involving the remaining amount were considered during sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ryan Lim said that on March 3, 2015, Banch asked the woman to open a bank account. She did so on March 11 that year and gave him details such as the personal identification number. The court heard that another woman was later duped into believing she had been sent a parcel containing money and gifts, and that ""clearance fees"" had to be paid to receive it. The woman deposited $2,000 into the croupier's account. She alerted the police on March 26 that year. The croupier was called up about three months later to Ang Mo Kio Police Division headquarters, where an officer recorded her statement. The DPP said the officer advised the croupier to stop contacting Banch, and to not allow him to use her bank account. Despite this, the croupier continued to help Banch in August 2015 and allowed over $855,000 to be deposited into three other bank accounts linked to her and her family members. The money came from two other victims of cheating. A 52-year-old woman was duped in a parcel scam and made deposits totalling more than $250,000. The other victim was a 58-year-old woman who was duped into making 15 deposits totalling about $606,000. Between Sept 5 and Nov 2, 2015, the croupier made withdrawals from the bank accounts and handed the cash over to other people as directed by Banch. The court heard that he gave her $4,000, which she claimed were transport fees.

Indian national Thirumal Pavithran, 25, was sentenced yesterday to 10 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to four counts of remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit. The court heard that Thirumal, who was born in India, became a Singapore PR on June 16, 1997. He attended primary and secondary education in Singapore from 2001 to 2009, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Kee. But on May 19, 2009, he left for India to continue with his secondary education there. Thirumal became subject to the Enlistment Act when he turned 161/2 years old on Nov 1 the following year. A registration notice was then sent to his Singapore address on July 22, 2011, asking him to register for NS from Aug 10 to 31 that year. However, he failed to register for it. A further reporting order was sent to the address on Sept 5, 2011, telling him to report to the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) for a medical screening. He failed to comply with both orders although he returned to Singapore 23 days later and stayed for about a week before returning to India. He came back to Singapore on Oct 16, 2012, before the police arrested him a week later. Thirumal finally reported to the CMPB on Oct 24 that year and was assessed to be fit for enlistment for full-time NS. But he later contacted CMPB, saying that he wanted to apply for a deferment so that he could attend university in India. DPP Kee said: ""On April 1, 2013, the CMPB e-mailed the accused with a letter emphasising that he was eligible for deferment only until May 31, 2013, for him to complete his Standard 12 education in India and that he was not eligible for deferment for his university studies."" Thirumal was then scheduled for enlistment in the June 2013 intake. Despite this, he ignored the order and returned to Singapore on June 8, 2016, after completing his university education in India. He reported to the CMPB three days later and was subsequently enlisted into full-time NS which he completed on May 12 this year. In an earlier statement, the Ministry of Defence said it takes a firm stance against those who commit offences under the Enlistment Act. ""All male Singapore citizens and permanent residents have a duty to serve NS,"" it said. ""If we allow Singapore citizens or PRs who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined."" Those convicted of remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $10,000 for each charge. "

However, when pressed on the details, he said he could have remembered wrongly. Taking the stand during a trial where two SCDF officers linked to Cpl Kok's death are contesting charges against them, First Warrant Officer Mulifatullah Atan said one of the men on trial, rota commander Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, had stepped in to stop it. But among the various points he made, he was unable to back some up or said he had remembered the details wrongly when grilled during cross-examination. On the night of May 13 last year, Cpl Kok, 22, drowned after he was pushed into the Tuas View Fire Station pump well, or kolam, in a ragging ritual that was part of activities to mark the completion of his national service.

He thought Staff Sgt Chang would have made Cpl Kok enter the well based on his actions and mention of kolam. Chong's defence lawyer, Mr Wee Pan Lee, pressed him on this and brought up differing testimony by Staff Sgt Chang. On Monday, Staff Sgt Chang testified that he got into a ""friendly tussle"" with Cpl Kok during the game, but did not mention having said the word ""kolam"" then. This prompted WO1 Mulifatullah to say: ""I heard someone mention kolam... but I don't remember if he's the one."" The ongoing trial involves Chong, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer who was deputy rota commander. The two were in charge of the station that night. They were each charged with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. The two had allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. That evening, the servicemen on duty had gathered in the fire station's control room to hold a cake-cutting ceremony for Cpl Kok. WO1 Mulifatullah said he left the room after the celebration and was speaking with Nazhan outside. When he returned, he saw Chong and Sergeant Mohamed Hanis Mohamed Hussain there. On Wednesday, however, Sgt Hanis testified that he had left the room during the ceremony and when he returned, only Chong was there. He did not mention WO1 Mulifatullah. When Mr Wee asked whose version the court should accept, WO1 Mulifatullah said that he could not remember if Sgt Hanis had been there. Said Mr Wee: ""You have asserted something you could have been mistaken about. Having said that he was there, and now saying he was not there, this raises questions about which part of your evidence is like that too."" That night, some officers carried Cpl Kok across the yard towards the pump well, and WO1 Mulifatullah was among those gathered there. The defence also tried to poke holes in WO1 Mulifatullah's statement that he had seen Cpl Kok flash an ""unwilling"" smile moments before he was pushed into the pump well. Nazhan's lawyer, Mr Singa Retnam, asked: ""He took his shirt off and sat down by himself without anyone physically forcing him to, how do you know he was unwilling?"" WO1 Mulifatullah said: ""It was more of my opinion when I saw him in that moment."" The trial continues today. "

The 41-year-old Singaporean lawyer was later found with a stolen Malaysian passport which had actually been issued to a 43-year-old man whose photograph bore some resemblance to Ong. The lawyer was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why he had the passport with him. Thus, police believe he has the knowledge and means to abscond. Yesterday, defence lawyer Jennifer Sia asked the court to release Ong on bail, stressing that he has a young son. Ong is currently in remand. But DPP Khoo highlighted the police findings and urged District Judge Luke Tan to not grant Ong bail as he poses a high flight risk. The judge agreed with the DPP, and Ong was not offered bail. The Straits Times had earlier reported that the monies, which were held in escrow by JLC Advisors for its client Allied Technologies, went missing last month. Ong became uncontactable soon after. Escrow is an essential service in capital markets that supports transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. Police investigations showed that Ong had left for Malaysia after he was pressed into accounting for unauthorised withdrawals of clients' monies by the partners in his law firm. Ong left Singapore in a private-hire car after making arrangements with a friend known only as Nicholas. Apart from his wife, Ong did not inform anyone else of his plans to travel to Malaysia, the court heard. In Malaysia, he met with one Dennis, a friend of Nicholas. Dennis initially took Ong to his office, and the lawyer stayed there for two or three days, police investigations revealed. The accused then moved to a hotel in Cheras, Vivatel Kuala Lumpur. Ong became uncontactable on May 16 after he got rid of his mobile phone and asked Dennis to provide him with another. Police found that Ong then inserted a China SIM card into the phone Dennis gave him and used it for telecommunications while he was in Malaysia. The court heard that Ong stayed at the hotel until officers from the Royal Malaysia Police arrested him on May 29. Ong was found to be in possession of the stolen Malaysian passport, which he had obtained from another friend known only as Calvin. The lawyer was brought back to Singapore on May 30. He was charged with eight counts of forgery and one count of cheating earlier this month. Ong was in court yesterday to face 13 more charges of forgery for the purpose of cheating. He is now accused of creating false documents on March 27 to dupe one Chan Yi Zhang into believing that more than US$4.8 million (S$6.5 million) held in escrow by JLC Advisors was present and unused in its bank account. The lawyer is said to have fraudulently created bank statements for most months between October 2017 and February this year. According to court documents, the money was linked to a settlement involving two firms - trading company Airtrust Singapore and Wrangwell. Court documents did not reveal how or if Airtrust Singapore and Wrangwell were linked to Allied Technologies. Ong's case has been adjourned to July 11. "

Indian national Thirumal Pavithran, 25, was sentenced on Thursday (June 20) to 10 weeks' jail after  The court heard that Thirumal, who was born in India, became a Singapore PR on June 16, 1997. He received primary and secondary education in Singapore from 2001 to 2009, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Kee. But on May 19, 2009, he left for India to continue with his secondary education there. Thirumal became subject to the Enlistment Act when he turned 16½ years old on Nov 1 the following year. A registration notice was then sent to his Singapore address on July 22, 2011, asking him to register for NS from Aug 10 to 31 that year. However, he failed to register for it. A further reporting order was sent to the address on Sept 5, 2011, telling him to report to the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) for a medical screening. He failed to comply with both orders even though he returned to Singapore 23 days later and stayed for about a week before returning to India. He came back to Singapore on Oct 16, 2012, before the police arrested him a week later. Thirumal finally reported to the CMPB on Oct 24 that year and was assessed to be fit for enlistment for full-time NS. But he later contacted CMPB, saying that he wanted to apply for a deferment so that he could attend university in India. DPP Kee said: ""On April 1, 2013, the CMPB e-mailed the accused with a letter emphasising that he was eligible for deferment only until May 31, 2013, for him to complete his Standard 12 education in India and that he was not eligible for deferment for his university studies."" Thirumal was then scheduled for enlistment in the June 2013 intake. Despite this, he ignored the order and returned to Singapore on June 8, 2016, after completing his university education in India. He reported to the CMPB three days later and was subsequently enlisted into full-time NS which he completed on May 12 this year. In an earlier statement, the Ministry of Defence said it takes a firm stance against those who commit offences under the Enlistment Act. ""All male Singapore citizens and permanent residents have a duty to serve NS,"" it had said. ""If we allow Singapore citizens or PRs who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined."" Those convicted of remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $10,000 for each charge. "

However, when pressed on the details, he said he could have remembered wrongly. Taking the stand during the ongoing trial where two SCDF officers linked with Cpl Kok's death are contesting charges, First Warrant Officer (WO1) Mulifatullah Atan told the court that one of the men on trial, rota commander Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, had stepped in to stop it. But among the various points he made on the stand, WO1 Mulifatullah was unable to back some up or said he had remembered the details wrongly when grilled during cross-examination. On the night of May 13 last year,  WO1 Mulifatullah said that, about four hours before the incident, some officers had been playing soccer in the yard and Staff Sergeant Al-Khudaifi Chang had held onto Cpl Kok and said the word kolam in a bid to get the full-time national serviceman to enter the nearby pump well. He said he thought that Staff Sgt Chang would have made Cpl Kok enter the well based on his actions and mention of kolam. Chong's defence lawyer, Mr Wee Pan Lee, pressed him on this point and brought up differing testimony given by Staff Sgt Chang earlier on Monday. On Monday, Staff Sgt Chang told the court that he got into a ""friendly tussle"" with Cpl Kok during the soccer game, but did not mention having said the word kolam then. Said Mr Wee: ""I'm asking you, do you accept Al-Khudaifi's testimony or are you sticking to your own?"" This prompted WO1 Mulifatullah to say: ""I heard someone mention kolam... but I don't remember if he's the one."" The ongoing trial involves Chong, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer who was deputy rota commander. The two were in charge of the station that night. They were each charged with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. The two had allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. On the evening before the fatal incident, the servicemen on duty had gathered in the fire station's control room to hold a cake-cutting ceremony for Cpl Kok. Giving his account of that night, WO1 Mulifatullah said he left the room after the celebration and was having a discussion with Nazhan outside. When he returned, he saw Chong and another officer, Sergeant Mohamed Hanis Mohamed Hussain, there. On Wednesday, however, Sgt Hanis testified that he had left the control room during the ceremony and when he returned, only Chong was there, with no mention of WO1 Mulifatullah. When asked by Mr Wee on whose version the court should accept, WO1 Mulifatullah said he could not remember if Sgt Hanis had been there. Said Mr Wee: ""You have asserted something you could have been mistaken about. Having said that he was there, and now saying he was not there, this raises questions about which part of your evidence is like that too."" That night, WO1 Mulifatullah was among the officers who had gathered around the pump well after some of them had carried Cpl Kok across the yard to the well. Defence lawyers for Chong and Nazhan tried to poke holes in WO1 Mulifatullah's statement that he had seen an ""unwilling"" smile flash across Cpl Kok's face moments before he was pushed into the pump well. Nazhan's lawyer, Mr Singa Retnam, asked: ""He had taken his shirt off, sat down by himself, all without anyone physically forcing him to, how do you know he was unwilling?"" ""It was more of my opinion when I saw him in that moment,"" said WO1 Mulifatullah. The trial continues on Friday (June 21). "

Instead of lying low while on the run, Saatish Gautham, then 19, teamed up with two other youths last year and tried to break into two Little India jewellery stores by using an oxy-acetylene blowtorch that can be used to cut through metals. Saatish, now 20, pleaded guilty in court yesterday to two counts of attempted housebreaking. His two accomplices, Mohammad Faris Mohammad Fadzir, 17, and Jamal Razeen Abdul Ghani, 19, admitted to their offences last year. They were both sentenced to reformative training - Jamal in May and Faris in August - where they have to follow a strict regimen that includes foot drills and counselling. Yesterday, Saatish also admitted to an unrelated rioting charge. The court heard that in 2013 and 2014, he was placed on probation for offences including being a member of an unlawful assembly and causing mischief by fire. He re-offended while on probation and was sentenced to reformative training in 2015 after committing theft. In November 2017, he was placed under supervision at the Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre near Upper Changi Road North but failed to report to his reintegration officer on March 5 last year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Dwayne Lum said some time early that month, Jamal suggested to Saatish to break into jewellery shops and steal their valuables. Jamal roped in Faris on March 9 last year. Jamal ordered the blowtorch and had it delivered to Saatish's home in Boon Lay. Around 2am on March 11, the three youths went to Little India. Jamal and Faris acted as lookouts, while Saatish went to the rear door of Merlin Goldsmith and Jewellery in Serangoon Road. Saatish used the blowtorch to cut the hinges. But the group fled to Jamal's Jelapang Road flat in Bukit Panjang after Faris spotted a man observing Saatish. The trio returned to Little India later that morning. Saatish and Faris went to the front entrance of the Jewel Palace in Buffalo Road. Court documents did not reveal Jamal's location at the time. The DPP said Saatish used the blowtorch to dismantle the store's roller shutters, while Faris used a hammer to smash a lock. But when the anti-theft alarm went off, the pair fled the scene empty-handed before meeting up with Jamal. The case has been adjourned to July 3. "

Ten of the dogs later died of parvovirus - a contagious illness that affects dogs - while one had to be euthanised. The vessel owner, Singaporean Cheow Yon Siong, 53, was sentenced yesterday to 20 months' jail. He pleaded guilty to two offences under the Animals and Birds Act - illegally importing the puppies and failing to ensure that they were not kept in confinement and subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering. Cheow also admitted possessing methamphetamine and consuming the drug. He was sentenced to 6½ years' jail last August for drug trafficking, and will serve his latest sentence after completing his earlier one. The court heard that on Oct 23, 2016, Malaysian Yeun Jian Iun, 23, received a call from a man, known only as Mat, asking him to smuggle puppies to Singapore for $1,000. Five days later, Yeun went to Cheow's flat in Hougang and the pair took a taxi to Marina Country Club. They then took a pleasure craft to Sebana Cove in Johor to collect six cages containing nine poodles, five shih tzus, four pomeranians, three French bulldogs and two golden retrievers. The vessel left Malaysia and was on its way back to Singapore around 3.40pm when Cheow sought clearance from the Singapore authorities via walkie-talkie. About 20 minutes later, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers arrived in a boat to collect the two men's passports. Police Coast Guard Sergeant Muhammad Roshdee Eepsooni heard barking while checking the Singapore-registered boat. He traced the barking to cargo on board that was covered with large pieces of cloth. The court heard that the puppies were ""crammed into rigid pet carriers that were too small"" for them. The case was then referred to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). AVA prosecuting officer Yap Teck Chuan said an important purpose of the Animals and Birds Act is to prevent the entry of diseases, especially rabies, into Singapore. Singapore has been free from rabies since 1953, and the consequences of a rabies outbreak would be dire, he said. The puppies in this case were from Malaysia, which had an outbreak of rabies in 2015, and which has not been declared free from rabies since. Yeun was earlier dealt with in court and sentenced to eight months' jail in December 2016. "

Tan Kok Leong, in his mid-50s, had admitted to his conviction to the disciplinary tribunal of the Singapore Medical Council (SMC). But he ""declined to plead guilty as he wished to maintain his position that he was innocent of the charges"", according to the grounds of decision issued by the SMC this week. He had also said through his lawyers that he would not contest the charges. On July 5 and 6 in 2013, Tan gave his patient, a Malaysian doctor, a sleeping drug in the course of a liposuction procedure in a hotel room at Oasia Hotel. He molested the man and took more than 20 lewd photographs. He was found guilty of molesting the 33-year-old man and sentenced to 3½ years' jail in 2016. His jail term was increased to 4½ years in 2017 after the prosecution appealed. In its decision, the tribunal said the case was unprecedented in terms of the serious nature of the charges, the brazenness with which they were committed, and the penalties imposed by the High Court. ""It is axiomatic that patients place their bodily and physical integrity in the trust and care of their treating physician,"" the tribunal said. ""Any breach of this trust brings irreparable harm to the reputation and good standing of the medical profession as a whole. ""It follows that any medical practitioner convicted of a sexual offence in relation to a patient should, by that very act, be considered to be unfit to practise in this hallowed profession,"" it added. In mitigation, Tan's lawyer said his client was active in charity work, including removing tattoos for former prisoners under the Yellow Ribbon Project. Tan claimed to be a pioneer in the field of liposuction and some of his patients and fellow doctors had given him positive character references. His lawyer argued that ""the circumstances of the offence were highly exceptional and had to be weighed against his achievements in the course of a distinguished career"", and asked for a two-year suspension. The tribunal noted that removing a doctor's name from the register is the most severe penalty and not one to be imposed lightly. ""The conduct must be of a nature that is inimical to the fundamental mission of the medical practitioner,"" it said. However, given ""the degree of depravity involved"", the tribunal felt that its decision was justified. Tan had not only ""detained the patient without his permission for two days, and manhandled him at his whim and fancy in the most degrading manner"", but also took photographs. ""It cannot be over-emphasised that had the images found their way to broader circulation on the Internet, they would have caused incalculable harm to the reputation and dignity of the patient,"" it said. ""The inherent risk involved in such voyeuristic photography is therefore a clear aggravating factor,"" it added. "

The phrase ""Go down, faster"", in Mandarin, is heard repeatedly in video footage that captured the last moments of Cpl Kok, 22, before he was pushed into the 12m-deep well on the night of May 13 last year. The instruction was directed at Cpl Sok Leng, a swimming instructor who was told to be on standby in case anything went awry, Staff Sergeant Ng Meng Kiat told the court yesterday. Testifying during the ongoing trial involving two SCDF officers linked to Cpl Kok's death, Staff Sgt Ng said he gave the instruction so quickly after the full-time national serviceman fell into the pump well out of ""instinct"" when Cpl Kok did not resurface. Cpl Kok was pushed into the pump well in a ragging ritual that was part of activities to mark the completion of his national service. Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer, were rota commander and deputy rota commander, respectively, and were in charge of the station that night. They were each charged with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. The duo had allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. After Cpl Kok fell into the well, the group gathered there mounted a rescue operation where some, including Staff Sgt Ng, entered the well while others used equipment to pump water out of it. Staff Sgt Ng was the one who found and retrieved Cpl Kok's body. The group managed to pull Cpl Kok out of the well but, by this time, 36 minutes had passed and the Malaysian national and Singapore permanent resident had drowned. In security camera footage before the push, Staff Sgt Ng is seen running ahead of the group carrying Cpl Kok and opening the pump well's gate. When asked why he did this, he said he thought they were playing a prank that would stop if Cpl Kok chose not to enter the well. Also taking the stand yesterday was Sergeant Mohamed Hanis Mohamed Hussain, who was not present when the group began carrying Cpl Kok to the pump well. When the officers on duty gathered in the control room for the cake-cutting ceremony for Cpl Kok, Sgt Hanis said he remembered people talking about the ""kolam"", which refers to the pump well in Malay. While he understood the ""kolam"" to refer to a ritual that involved putting people in the pump well, he said he was not concerned at that point. ""I felt that we were making fun of each other,"" said Sgt Hanis, who left the room after the celebration. When he returned to the room after about five minutes, he saw only Chong, who left a few minutes later. Sgt Hanis realised that something had happened only when he saw people running in the yard. Earlier, witnesses had testified that at some point in the night, Chong had stuck his head out the room window and told those at the well not to film the incident. However, Sgt Hanis did not recall this. The trial continues today. "

The police had earlier advised her to stop communicating with the man, known as William Banch, but she continued helping him. The 48-year-old woman, who lost her job as a croupier during investigations, was sentenced on Wednesday (June 19) to three years and four months' jail. The Singaporean pleaded guilty to three counts of dealing with the proceeds of criminal activities totalling nearly $230,000. Thirty-seven other charges involving the remaining amount were considered during sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ryan Lim said that on March 3, 2015, Banch asked the woman to open a bank account. She did as told on March 11 that year and gave him details such as the personal identification number the next day. Banch also instructed her to give the ATM card to a man known as Fred in Johor Baru. The court heard that another woman was later duped into believing she had been sent a parcel containing money and gifts, and that ""clearance fees"" had to be paid to receive it. The woman deposited $2,000 into the croupier's account. She later realised she had been cheated in a parcel scam, and alerted the police on March 26 that year. The croupier was called up about three months later to go to Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters, where an officer recorded her statement. The DPP said the officer advised the croupier to stop contacting Banch, and not allow him to use her bank account. Despite this, the croupier continued to help Banch in August 2015 and allowed more than $855,000 to be deposited into three other bank accounts linked to her and her family members. The money came from two other victims of cheating. A 52-year-old woman was duped in a parcel scam and made five deposits totalling more than $250,000. The other victim was a 58-year-old woman duped into making payments to purportedly help a man's business. She made 15 deposits totalling about $606,000. Between Sept 5 and Nov 2, 2015, the croupier made withdrawals from the bank accounts and handed over the cash to other people as directed by Banch. The court heard that he gave her $4,000 which she claimed were transport fees. The DPP said: ""Save for any claims against the monies frozen in the accounts, none of the monies transferred by the victims to the accused have been recovered."" On Wednesday, defence lawyer Amarjit Singh pleaded for not more than 2½ years' jail and told the court his client is not highly educated. The lawyer from Amarjit Sidhu Law added: ""This has been a painful lesson for her and she will never reoffend."" Offenders convicted of dealing with the proceeds of criminal conduct can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000 for each charge. "

However, he told the court that the centre had helped him further his studies and let him sit for his O levels. Judge Tham has called for a report from the RTC on the claims made by Saatish and the case has been adjourned to July 3. For attempted housebreaking, he can be jailed for up to seven years and fined for each charge. "

The vessel owner, Singaporean Cheow Yon Siong, 53, was sentenced on Wednesday (June 19) to 20 months' jail. He pleaded guilty to two offences under the Animals and Birds Act - illegally importing the puppies and failing to ensure that they were not kept in confinement and subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering. Cheow also admitted possessing methamphetamine and consuming the drug. He was sentenced to 6½ years' jail last August for drug trafficking, and will serve his latest sentence after completing his earlier one. The court heard that on Oct 23, 2016, a Malaysian, Yeun Jian Iun, 23, received a call from a man known only as Mat, asking him to smuggle puppies to Singapore for $1,000. Five days later, Yeun went to Cheow's flat in Hougang and the pair took a taxi to Marina Country Club. They then took a pleasure craft to Sebana Cove in Johor to collect six cages containing nine poodles, five shih tzus, four pomeranians, three French bulldogs and two golden retrievers. The vessel left Malaysia and was on its way back to Singapore at around 3.40pm when Cheow sought clearance from Singapore authorities via walkie-talkie. About 20 minutes later, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers arrived in a boat to collect the two men's passports. Police Coast Guard officer Sergeant Muhammad Roshdee Eepsooni heard barking while checking the Singapore-registered pleasure craft. He traced the barking to some cargo on board covered by large pieces of cloth, and found the puppies. The court heard that they were ""cramped into rigid pet carriers that were too small"" for them. The case was then referred to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). AVA prosecuting officer Yap Teck Chuan said an important purpose of the Animals and Birds Act is to prevent the entry of diseases, especially rabies, into Singapore. Singapore has been free from rabies since 1953, and the consequences of a rabies outbreak would be dire, he said. The puppies in this case were from Malaysia, which had an outbreak of rabies in 2015, and which  The World Health Organisation estimated the number of human deaths caused by rabies - a fatal viral disease transmitted through the bite of an infected animal - each year to be 60,000. Yeun was  On April 1 this year, AVA was restructured to form the Singapore Food Agency as well as the Animal and Veterinary Service, which comes under the National Parks Board. "

Mr Keane's brother and administrator of his estate, Mr Colin Joseph Keane, has filed a claim against taxi driver Ko Ngak Phweng and part-time driver Tan Yeow Kim for damages and the loss suffered by his parents from their negligence. According to court documents filed by the plaintiff, the late Mr Keane was working as a director of information technology at Singtel and earning a monthly average of $20,372, including allowances. As a result of the accident, his life was ""considerably shortened"" at age 41 and his aged parents who were dependent on him have suffered, said his brother, who is represented by Mr Nandakumar Renganathan and Ms Shalini Mogan from RHTLaw Taylor Wessing. On May 6 that year, Mr Ko was ferrying Mr Keane and another passenger, Mr Anthony Gerard John Hall, from the airport to Cairnhill at around midnight. While travelling on the CTE, the taxi driver failed to see a limousine that had stopped in the left-most lane, and crashed into the black Mercedes-Benz driven by Ms Tan. Ms Tan was driving Mr Charles Robert Allenbach Jr to his Bukit Timah home when she missed the Bukit Timah Road exit, stopped the car, and reversed against the flow of traffic to get to the exit. In October 2016, Mr Ko admitted failing to keep a proper lookout and by the time he saw the Mercedes, it was too late to stop. His taxi hit the back of the car, which surged forward and hit a bollard. While the other two passengers survived the collision, Mr Keane was pronounced dead at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at around 2.20am. Mr Ko, then 58, was sentenced to three weeks' jail and banned from driving for five years, while Ms Tan, then 57, was sentenced to four weeks' jail and banned from driving for five years for dangerous driving. Relying on the fact that they had pleaded guilty to their offences, Mr Keane's brother is seeking damages in excess of $1 million, including a monthly $1,500 allowance to each parent since the death of Mr Keane in 2015 and up to 10 years following the completion of the lawsuit, as well as funeral expenses and grief counselling for his parents. Mr Ko, represented by lawyers from United Legal Alliance, and Ms Tan, represented by lawyers from Tan Kok Quan Partnership, have denied the claims. They both note that Mr Keane was himself negligent in not wearing a seat belt. Ms Tan added that while she had pleaded guilty to the offence of dangerous driving in relation to the same accident, this does not amount to an admission of liability.

The responsibilities of high-ranking Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers were set out during a testimony yesterday by Colonel Anthony Toh, commander of the 4th SCDF Division. Taking the stand in the ongoing trial of two SCDF commanders linked to the drowning of Corporal Kok Yuen Chin, a full-time national serviceman, Col Toh said: ""The commander on duty must walk the ground... The men would not have the opportunity to engage in horseplay because you could walk in on them anytime."" Responding to questions about the chain of command and responsibility in a fire station, he told the court that those directly involved in an incident would be held accountable, but the rota commanders would still bear overall responsibility for the actions of their men. On May 13 last year, Cpl Kok, 22, drowned after he was pushed into the Tuas View Fire Station's pump well in a ragging incident to mark the completion of his national service. The two on trial, Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer, were rota commander and deputy rota commander respectively. They were in charge of the station that night. They were each charged with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission, and had allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the well. In court, Col Toh, who has been with the force since 2005, said there were 11 reported cases of ragging in the SCDF from 2010 to 2017, of which one involved the ""kolam"" ritual, where officers entered the fire station's pump well. He said the SCDF defined ragging as a physical or verbal act that would or is likely to ""cause bodily harm, injury or mental anguish"". The court had earlier heard that Chong had been in the nearby control room when this happened. At one point, he stuck his head out of the room's window to tell them not to record any video of the incident. In another video, a man identified as Nazhan is seen walking off after the group places Cpl Kok on the ground near the well. Nazhan's lawyer suggested his client left the scene as he thought nothing would happen. Col Toh said if a commander sees this and does not stop it, ""he is not fit to be a commander"". ""If (the commanders) see something that is not authorised and don't put a stop to it, it's an accident waiting to happen, and in this case it did happen."" The trial continues today. "

Tan Sze Hian, 44, was working as a sales executive for Subaru distributor Motor Image Singapore when he convinced car buyers to write out cheques to himself, instead of the company. He also offered to help some customers sell their vehicles in his personal capacity - but kept the proceeds for himself. Tan was sentenced to 3½ years' jail on Tuesday (June 18) after pleading guilty to two counts of criminal breach of trust involving nearly $370,000. Four other charges linked to the remaining amount were considered during sentencing. He began working with the company, based in Leng Kee Road near Commonwealth Avenue, in 2012 and was tasked with serving walk-in customers who were looking to buy new cars. His job scope also included preparing the necessary sales documentation and he was entrusted with collecting payments from them. Deputy Public Prosecutor Angela Ang said purchases would usually be partially funded by a bank loan or a used car trade-in, and some customers would write cheques to pay off their outstanding balance. But instead of following the company's standard policy of writing a crossed cheque, ""the accused would instruct these customers to pay the outstanding balance to him by way of a cash cheque, on the representation that he would thereafter transfer the payment to Motor Image"". Tan misappropriated nearly $346,000 between Sept 30 and Nov 8, 2017. DPP Ang said Tan would also convince Motor Image customers to sell their old cars through him to obtain a ""more profitable deal"". One victim bought a new Subaru Forester from Motor Image in September 2017. The customer agreed to hand over his old Honda Civic to Tan who promised to sell it for $25,000. Tan managed to sell it for $27,000 - then pocketed the proceeds. His offences came to light when customers started hounding him. He later came clean about what he had done to his general manager, who alerted the firm's director. A police report was made on Dec 22, 2017. On Tuesday, DPP Ang urged the court to sentence Tan to 3½ years' jail, stressing that he had made no restitution. Defence lawyer Henry Lim, who was assigned to the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, told the court that his client ""deeply regrets the day he stepped into a casino"", adding: ""Looking back in profound remorse, he knows he has no one to blame but himself."" For misappropriating the firm's money, Tan could have been jailed for up to 15 years and fined. "

On May 6, 2015, Mr Ko was ferrying Mr Keane and another passenger, Mr Anthony Gerard John Hall, from the airport to Cairnhill at around midnight. While travelling on the CTE, the taxi driver failed to see a limousine that had stopped in the left-most lane, and crashed into the black Mercedes-Benz driven by Ms Tan. Ms Tan had been driving Mr Charles Robert Allenbach Jr to his Bukit Timah home when she missed the Bukit Timah Road exit, stopped the car, and was reversing against the flow of traffic to get to her exit. During a court hearing in October 2016, Mr Ko admitted that he failed to keep a proper lookout and by the time he saw the Mercedes-Benz, it was too late to stop. His taxi hit the back of the car, which surged forward and hit a bollard. While the other two passengers survived the collision, Mr Keane was pronounced dead at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at around 2.20am. For causing the death of Mr Keane through his negligence, the taxi driver, who was 58 years old then, was sentenced to three weeks' jail and banned from driving for five years. Ms Tan, then 57, was sentenced to four weeks' jail and banned from driving for five years for dangerous driving. Relying on the fact that Mr Ko and Ms Tan had pleaded guilty to their offences, Mr Keane's brother is seeking damages in excess of $1 million, including a monthly $1,500 allowance to each parent since the death of Mr Keane in 2015 and up to 10 years following the completion of the lawsuit. The amount also includes funeral expenses, grief counselling for his parents, and the costs of repatriating Mr Keane's personal belongings from Singapore and Australia to Ireland. In defence papers filed by Mr Ko, who was represented by lawyers from United Legal Alliance, he denied the claims. Instead, he argued that the accident was caused by the combined negligence of Mr Keane and Ms Tan. In particular, Mr Ko noted that Mr Keane had failed to wear a seat belt, while Ms Tan had stopped and reversed her vehicle along the expressway. Ms Tan, in her defence papers filed by lawyers from Tan Kok Quan Partnership, also denied the claims made by the plaintiff. She noted that at the time of the accident, she had switched on her hazard lights upon stopping her vehicle near the bollards of the chevron markings, and had turned her head physically to look in the rear. She also claimed she had ""slowly reversed her car as there were no motor vehicles approaching her from the rear"". Instead, the collision was caused by the negligence of Mr Ko, who had failed to keep a proper lookout and was driving at ""an excessive speed"". In addition, Ms Tan claimed that Mr Keane's fatal injuries had been caused or contributed by his own negligence of not wearing a seat belt. She added that while she had pleaded guilty to the offence of dangerous driving in relation to the same accident in 2016, this does not amount to an admission of liability.

This was told to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officer by rota mate Staff Sergeant (SSgt) Adighazali Suhaimi during the cake-cutting ceremony on the night of May 13 last year. They had gathered in the control room at Tuas View Fire Station to celebrate Cpl Kok's impending operationally ready date. SSgt Adighazali had told Cpl Kok, 22, a Malaysian national and Singapore permanent resident, of the possibility he would be pushed into the 12m-deep pump well, also known as the ""kolam"". SSgt Adighazali was testifying yesterday in the ongoing trial of two SCDF officers, each charged with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer, were rota commander and deputy rota commander, respectively, that night. The duo, who were in charge of the fire station then, had allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. In his testimony, SSgt Adighazali, 33, said he offered Cpl Kok ""brotherly advice"", to choose between two options. He did this because he believed there was less chance of injury if one entered the pump well himself, as compared to when someone else pushed him in. SSgt Adighazali also believed that someone might have pushed Cpl Kok into the well if he did not enter on his own as there was ""persistent cheering to want to see him go in"", he told the court. Cpl Kok was eventually pushed into the pump well as part of activities to mark the completion of his national service. He later drowned. For their role in the incident, three more officers were also charged, of which two - including SSgt Adighazali - have been convicted. Last December, SSgt Adighazali was jailed a month after he pleaded guilty to intentionally obstructing the course of justice by deleting video footage that showed Cpl Kok sitting at the edge of the pump well. He has finished his sentence. Yesterday, SSgt Adighazali said that up till the moment when they carried and put Cpl Kok next to the well, he thought it was a prank. ""We thought that the prank stopped there,"" he said, adding that there was then a ""commotion"" with people around the well cheering and urging Cpl Kok to enter it. At some point, someone told them to stop the activity and SSgt Adighazali was told to quit taking the video, but the ""commotion"" continued. Chong's lawyer Wee Pan Lee asked him to elaborate on what he understood of this ""commotion"", and SSgt Adighazali said he thought that ""something was going to happen"", but did not think anyone would push the NSF into the well. But this was the moment SCDF officer Muhammad Nur Fatwa Mahmood, 34, pushed Cpl Kok in. While on the stand, SSgt Adighazali said if Cpl Kok had voiced his objection, the activity would have stopped. But the prosecution noted that transcripts of the video SSgt Adighazali took that night showed Cpl Kok did resist several times, including saying ""cannot encik,"" moments before he fell into the well. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sheryl Yeo asked: ""Why did you think nothing would have happened if Cpl Kok had said no?"" SSgt Adighazali said: ""In my mind, they didn't dare push anyone in."" The trial continues today. "

Chen Jianbang, 31, was sentenced to 13 months' jail and nine strokes of the cane yesterday. The Singaporean pleaded guilty to two counts of deliberately wounding the racial feelings of others and three charges under the Vandalism Act. Twelve other charges for similar offences were considered during sentencing. Chen must also spend an additional 60 days behind bars as he had breached a remission order after his early release from prison in August last year. In November 2017, he was sentenced to a year and nine months' jail for housebreaking. As part of the order, he was not supposed to commit any more offences between Aug 4 last year and March 4 this year.

The police responded to a call requesting for assistance at Block 163B Rivervale Crescent at 10.24pm and found a two-year-old child lying motionless in the bedroom of a unit in the block. A 34-year-old man was also found injured inside the same bedroom. Both the suspect and the child were taken to Sengkang General Hospital where the child was pronounced dead at 12.28am on Monday. The man, who is the father of the child, has been arrested, the statement said, adding that he will be charged in court on Tuesday. Police have classified the case as murder. Investigations are ongoing. The Straits Times understands that the suspect's name is Mr JohnBoy John Teo, who is married with a daughter. When ST visited the flat at 11pm on Monday, where the murder allegedly occurred, all was quiet with no police cordons in sight. The unit had been locked securely by the police, said neighbours. When interviewed, a next-door neighbour told ST that on the day of the incident, he did not notice any commotion or hear loud noises. The neighbour told ST that he saw the suspect's wife, her mother, and his father turn up at the apartment around 11pm on Sunday, before the police arrived. Several police officers arrived at the scene later, after which the apartment had to be broken into for investigators to enter. ""It was really shocking to hear that something like this had happened in our area,"" said the neighbour. He described the suspect and his wife as well-educated and friendly, and their daughter as a cute and well-adjusted girl. ""We have known them for several years, since we moved in. We don't know what could have happened, and this is very distressing - because we live next to them, and know them personally,"" he said. Another neighbour living downstairs told ST that he had been woken up in the middle of the night a few times in the last month by the sound of a wailing toddler. ""It wasn't the normal kind of crying you hear from a child. It was quite loud, and we are not light sleepers,"" said the neighbour, adding that he believes the sound came from the suspect's flat. <strong>Additional reporting by Shaffiq Alkhatib and Malavika Menon</strong> "

But there, on the fourth floor of the Housing Board block opposite his, was a man throwing shoes from the corridor. When the 56-year-old remembered that his children's shoes had gone missing from outside his flat a few months earlier, he alerted two of his fellow Citizens on Patrol (COP) members to contact police. He then headed to the ground floor with another COP member and saw that the man was there too, picking up the shoes he had thrown earlier. Before he could cycle away, Mr Hamid snapped photos of the footwear fiend. About 30 minutes later, the shoe stealer was caught by the police, thanks to his photos. Mr Hamid was among six members of the public awarded the Public Spiritedness Award on Monday (June 17) in a ceremony held at the Jurong Police Division. Fellow COP members Ms Winnie Tan, a 56-year-old caregiver at St Luke's ElderCare and Mdm Fatimah Hayon, a 55-year-old part-time house maid, were also lauded for stopping the thief. The other COP member involved was not at the ceremony. ""People in the neighbourhood had been complaining of missing shoes. I'm glad we stopped the thief,"" said Mr Hamid, who has been volunteering as a COP member for more than 20 years. Mr Tan Kay Huat, 51, received the award for helping the police chase down a man who was spotted stealing cash cards from vehicles at a multi-storey carpark in Jurong on Feb 22. Another recipient, 29-year-old Edmund Shao, took photos of suspects in an assault case, which led to their arrest. Mr Shao, who works in business services development, had earlier spotted six young men beating up two other men in a multi-purpose hall along Jelebu Road. He also provided police with the license plate number of the car some of the men fled in. Separately, the police presented four Singapore Post (SingPost) staff with Community Partnership Awards. They had helped to prevent 10 victims on 10 separate occasions from losing $5,500 in total to various scams. One case, that happened last year, involved a love scam. A retired middle-aged woman wanted to remit US$800 (S$1,096) to a person she had met online. But the intended recipient's Nigerian account raised red flags for SingPost staff Ms Nora Yasmin Zain. ""Love scams are quite common. Some telltale signs of such scams include the customer withholding information about the receiver, and the country of the receiver's bank account,"" said the 34-year-old who has been working at SingPost for 14 years. Assistant Commissioner (AC) of Police Devrajan Bala, Commander of Jurong Police Division, advised members of the public not to trust people they have never dealt and met with before. He added that they should always check that the transaction is with legitimate entities, especially if it involves a large sum of money. Community Partnership Awards were awarded to 22 companies in total including Keppel Offshore and Marine, which was represented by Mr Phillip Mah, the firm's general manager for security. Commending all recipients for their help in stopping crime, AC Devrajan said: ""We have to fight crime and we can't do it alone. We need to do it with the community."" "

Photos taken by onlookers of Mr Dhines Selvarajah, 27, lying injured on the road in Little India on July 25 were posted on social media. A district court heard that Mr Dhines cannot walk properly now. Yesterday, one of his attackers, Sharvin Raj Suraj, 18, pleaded guilty to one count each of rioting with a deadly weapon, being part of an unlawful assembly and having a knife in his possession. Sharvin is the first member of the group to be convicted for taking part in the attack. The cases against Haresh Shanmuganathan, 23, Arjun Retnavelu, 24, Victor Alexander Arumugam, 25, and Dinesh Kumar Ruvy, 28, are pending. At around 2.15pm on the day of the attack, Mr Dhines was sitting at a bus stop in Serangoon Road when he was spotted by the five Singaporean men, who were in a car. Deputy Public Prosecutor Pavithra Ramkumar told the court that the men had ""previous disputes"" with Mr Dhines and wanted to attack him. Court documents did not disclose details of the disputes. Dinesh, who was the driver, stopped the car by the side of the road. After the five men got out of the car, three of them retrieved some weapons from a box that Arjun had placed in the boot. Arjun picked a chopper, Dinesh chose a samurai sword and Sharvin took a baton, the DPP said. ""Haresh confirmed the identity of the victim and signalled to the accused and co-accused persons to attack,"" DPP Pavithra told District Judge May Mesenas. ""Arjun ran forward to the victim and started to slash him with the chopper. Dinesh then unsheathed the samurai sword and started slashing the victim with it. The accused then hit the victim with the baton and Haresh joined in by throwing punches and kicks at the victim,"" she said. The men left in the car after the attack. An ambulance took Mr Dhines to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was found to have suffered injuries including a partial amputation of his right foot and a wound at the back of his head. He was hospitalised for a week and given three months of hospitalisation leave. The Straits Times previously reported that the police nabbed the five within 16 hours of the attack. Separately, Sharvin admitted in court yesterday that he had a knife in his possession on June 3 last year. He was also part of an unlawful assembly while out on bail in January this year. Judge Mesenas has called for reports to assess Sharvin's suitability for reformative training and probation. The teenager is expected to be sentenced on July 5.

Muhammad Haikal Shah Md Ayuni, 24, was jailed for three years on Friday (June 14) after pleading guilty to performing part of the counterfeiting process. He also admitted to failing to report back to the Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre while on a work release scheme following an earlier conviction. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ang Siok Chen told the court that Haikal was sentenced to three years' jail on April 6, 2016, for drug consumption. On May 22, 2017, he was placed on the work release scheme and stayed at the community supervision centre in Cosford Road off Upper Changi Road North. The DPP said: ""Under the scheme, he was allowed to go to work every day and was required to report back to Lloyd Leas after his work. ""On Aug 14, 2017 at 8.30pm, the accused did not report back to Lloyd Leas after his work. He claimed that he did not want to report back to Lloyd Leas as he wanted to spend time with his pregnant girlfriend,"" the DPP added. In September last year, a man identified as Muhammad Farhan Farus, 25, contacted Haikal and asked to meet him in a rented apartment at the Lumiere condominium in Mistri Road near Shenton Way. Haikal went to the unit to meet Farhan and Muhammad Nabil Saini, 31. The men then engaged in a conspiracy to produce counterfeit currency notes, the court heard. DPP Ang told District Judge Edgar Foo: ""The accused and Farhan purchased an assortment of papers used as the medium for the printing of counterfeit currency notes. The counterfeit currency notes were printed at the unit. ""After the notes were printed... the accused was then tasked with cutting printouts of the currency notes to the correct size."" Farhan later used the fake notes to buy items on online marketplace Carousell and pay sex workers, said the DPP. Court documents did not reveal any details about the counterfeit notes and how the offences came to light. However, the court heard that officers from the Commercial Affairs Department finally arrested Haikal on Sept 13 last year. Nabil had earlier been sentenced to three years' jail while Farhan's case is still pending. For engaging in a conspiracy to produce counterfeit notes, Haikal could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined. "

As a result, it is possible he might inhale water while submerged. Forensic pathologist George Paul was pointing this out as he testified on Friday (June 14) in the ongoing trial of two commanders of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) linked with the drowning of full-time national serviceman Corporal Kok Yuen Chin, which happened during a ragging incident. Dr Paul, who performed the autopsy on Cpl Kok, said: ""There is also a difference between how one reacts when he is prepared to enter the water or when it is a sudden unexpected event."" If it is unexpected, it could also result in a startled ""inhalatory response"" that causes the person to breathe in water, he said, adding that it is a common misconception that when somebody enters a body of water, he or she will float. ""When a body floats up, it is often because of decomposition. If a person has the presence of mind to tread water... he will come up. But if he does not... water rushes into the lungs and he goes deeper and deeper into the water, he might not come up,"" added Dr Paul. On May 13 last year, Cpl Kok, a Malaysian national and Singapore permanent resident, was pushed into the Tuas View Fire Station's pump well as part of activities to mark the completion of his national service. In his report dated May 14, Dr Paul stated that the 22-year-old died of drowning. The two officers on trial - Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer - were rota commander and deputy rota commander respectively on the night of the incident. Chong and Nazhan were each charged in July last year with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. They had allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. Testifying on the fifth day of the trial, Dr Paul said there is a difference between how a swimmer and non-swimmer handles himself when entering a body of water. It had been earlier mentioned in court that the NSF did not know how to swim, and he had told this to at least one of his fellow SCDF officers in previous conversations. Dr Paul said being submerged in the pump well, which is a dark and confined space, might also cause one to be disoriented, and could have been dangerous even for a swimmer. ""Instead of surfacing, you might go in the opposite direction,"" he said, adding that this was just his opinion based on conjecture. In his autopsy report, Dr Paul noted that Cpl Kok's lips were blue from a lack of oxygen. Other signs including congested organs and the pooling of blood in some areas of the head indicated that he had drowned. He also said Cpl Kok had small injuries on his limbs and face, which were not significant, and larger bruises on the back of his head. Some of these, he said, could have come about during a struggle or through impact. Dr Paul also said plant matter was found when he did a microscopic examination of Cpl Kok's lungs. It could have come from remnants of leafy materials or algae. ""This was certainly not clean water, and such water can have an irritant effect,"" he added. Shortly after the autopsy, Dr Paul visited Tuas View Fire Station to take a look at the pump well as he wanted to understand more about the manner in which Cpl Kok died. He inspected the well and noticed that there was a platform in it. In blueprints of the well shown in court, the platform is located about halfway down the 12m-deep well. It has a 1m-wide hole in its centre that leads to the bottom. During the rescue operations on May 13 last year, Cpl Kok was found and retrieved from this smaller hole. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kumaresan Gohulabalan asked the doctor to comment on the possible injuries that could have resulted from the location where Cpl Kok was found. The pathologist said it was possible the platform could have contributed to the injuries. ""Multiple contact with the platform could have contributed to the smaller injuries,"" said Dr Paul, adding that he could not be definitive about it. The prosecution also took Dr Paul through some videos taken on the night of the incident. One in particular showed a close-up of Cpl Kok sitting on the edge of the well and being pushed in. When asked to comment on it, Dr Paul observed that while Cpl Kok would have likely fallen in feet first, it was possible that he could have bent over so his head pointed downwards and this could have contributed to his head injuries. When asked whether there was still the risk of drowning if Cpl Kok had not been pushed and had entered the well by gently lowering himself, Dr Paul said: ""If he is not used to water rushing into his nose, it is still dangerous. If he is not used to exhaling while his head is submerged, he might still drown."" During cross-examination by Chong's defence lawyer Wee Pan Lee, Dr Paul acknowledged that the dim lighting around the well and the possible cloudy water in it could have caused one to be disoriented. Mr Wee also asked if it would have been less dangerous if there was a contingency plan for a swimming instructor to pull the person out of the well as soon as he experiences difficulty. On the night of the incident, one of the officers, who was a swimming instructor, was told to be prepared in case something goes wrong. In a video shown in court, he could be seen removing his boots as Cpl Kok was on the ledge. However, Dr Paul said he was not confident that it would be less dangerous given that the person might be struggling and the instructor himself would be trying to stay afloat, coupled with the confined space of the well. ""I can only speculate that the swimming instructor might not have added much,"" said Dr Paul. The trial continues later in the day. "

The man was supposed to be HJ Luxury's first customer of the day when he walked in around noon on Wednesday, said shopkeepers at the store in Far East Plaza. He asked to view several Rolexes. But after the shopkeeper, who wanted to be known only as Ms Liew, presented some watches to him on a small tray, he purportedly snatched two of them and ran off while she was keeping some other timepieces. ""I thought something was fishy because the watches he was asking for were not suited for his age,"" said Ms Liew, 35. She and her older sister were the only two in the shop at the time. The store is owned by Mr Russell Tan, but he was not in at the time of the incident or when The Straits Times visited his shop. Ms Liew immediately gave chase, but the alleged thief, whom she described as tall and in his early 20s, fled via a nearby staircase leading to the main road. Shopkeepers from neighbouring stores joined in the chase, but they gave up after losing sight of him. While he escaped, the multiple closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras in the shop managed to capture his image, said Ms Liew. The alleged thief also left his fingerprints on multiple glass surfaces in the shop, she added, noting that he left behind his fake Rolex and an empty bag. The police took both items as evidence, she said. Ms Liew said she and the other storekeepers have discussed installing a glass door at the store entrance to prevent people from running off with their goods. ""We are all operating small shops here, we can't afford to hire a security guard for every shop,"" she said. The incident has rattled the confidence of shopkeepers in neighbouring stores. A store owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Wong, 50, and whose watch store is just two shops away from HJ Luxury, said he will lock the door behind every new customer who walks in from now on.

The 18-year-old, who is now a full-time national serviceman, was yesterday sentenced to 18 months' supervised probation. Under the conditions of the supervised probation, Ong must remain indoors from 10pm to 6am, and perform 120 hours of community service. To address his sexual offending, he must also attend sessions by a psychologist on healthy sexuality and responsible sexual conduct, as well as avoid being left alone with a child aged 12 and below unless supervised by an adult. His parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour during the period of probation. Ong had approached the girl, who was walking past the lift lobby area of Block 233 Pending Road on her way home from school, at about 3.15pm on July 12 last year. He asked her to be his model for a photography competition, and the girl agreed. She went with him to the second-floor staircase landing of the block, and as she was going up the steps, Ong patted her buttocks lightly. He apologised, which led the girl to believe it was accidental, according to court documents. Later, Ong asked the girl for permission to touch her legs and adjust her pose, which she agreed. He held the girl's knees and pushed her legs apart. This caused the girl to feel uncomfortable and she closed her legs, but Ong tried to do it again. However, the girl refused to budge. Ong then touched her chest before the girl pushed him away and left. Once she was home, the girl told her parents about the incident and they took her to the police station to lodge a report. After he was identified and arrested, Ong admitted to using the photography competition as an excuse to get the girl to go with him. He did not take any photos. He also claimed he had acted in a moment of impulse and regretted his actions afterwards. "

This was revealed by the pro-secution yesterday as it slapped Jeffrey Ong Su Aun with further charges and asked the court to extend his remand for the CAD to conduct its investigations. Ong, who appeared in court yesterday via a video link as he is held on remand, was charged with an additional eight counts of forgery for the purpose of cheating another company, CCJ Investments, into disbursing a sum of $6 million. This is on top of the one count of cheating that he was charged with on June 1. In addition, Ong is linked to the case of a missing sum of more than $33 million which was being held in escrow by JLC Advisors for its client Allied Technologies. Escrow is an essential service in capital markets that supports transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. Ong later became uncontactable. On May 30, with the assistance of the Royal Malaysia Police, he was caught in Malaysia and brought back to Singapore. According to court documents, the current nine charges came about as the lawyer allegedly committed forgery by fraudulently signing documents as James Tan Kwang Yong, the director and sole shareholder of Suite Development, and Joel Tan Guang Qian, the company secretary of Suite Development, on Feb 18 and 19. In doing so, Ong is said to have dishonestly induced CCJ Investments to disburse a sum of $6 million. According to court documents, some $3.3 million was then used to refinance Suite Development's mortgage loan and about $2.7 million was deposited into the account of a JLC Advisors client. According to records on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) website, Suite Development is a real estate developer which was registered on Sept 16, 2010. There was no information on CCJ Investments on the Acra portal. Ong will be back in court next Thursday. If convicted of forgery for the purpose of cheating, he could be jailed up to 10 years and fined. Following the incident, the Law Society has said that it may consider introducing rules and guidelines for operating escrow accounts after it completes its probe into JLC Advisors. Jeffrey Ong Su Aun resigns from his position as acting non-executive chairman and independent director of Annica Holdings, an engineering and oil and gas company, citing ""personal reasons"". Allied Technologies files a statement with the Singapore Exchange saying that about $33 million in an escrow account held by JLC Advisors is believed to have been paid out on the instructions of the law firm's managing partner Ong, who has been uncontactable for days. Allied Technologies adds that the payout may have been unauthorised, according to a letter it had received from JLC Advisors the day before. The Law Society seizes control of all client monies held by JLC Advisors. It says that it will launch an investigative audit on the law firm's client accounts. At the same time, Singapore Exchange Regulation, which had ordered Allied Technologies to undergo a special audit into why it had placed its funds with JLC, says the audit will be expanded to include developments surrounding the $33 million and the progress in trying to get the money back. Meanwhile, Ong's father says the family is shocked to learn about what happened, and he has been unable to reach his son since the previous week. Allied Technologies recuses three directors from all decisions and recommendations by its board because of conflict of interest in relation to the missing $33 million. They are independent director Karen Pok Mee Yau, who is a partner at JLC Advisors, executive director Kenneth Low Si Ren and independent director Lim Jin Wei. Mr Low's laptop and mobile phone are retained by police. He is also interviewed at the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) office, and later surrenders his passport. CAD also seizes information, records and documents from the premises of Allied Technologies and its subsidiaries. Ong is caught in Malaysia and taken back to Singapore. Ong is charged with one count of cheating another company, CCJ Investments, out of $6 million on Feb 19. Ong faces eight new charges of forgery for the purpose of cheating in the same case. He will be back in court on June 20. Prosecution says three more clients of JLC Advisors have come forward to CAD regarding missing monies totalling $16 million that were held by the law firm. <strong>Correction note: </strong> "

DPP Kumaresan asked: ""As a commander, if you were there at the edge of the pump well as Nazhan was, would you have left the scene?"" ""No, I wouldn't have left the scene,"" said Maj Huang. Maj Huang also observed in the video that the pump well gate was open, the men were gathered around the well, and that Cpl Kok was removing his valuables from his pocket. ""I would have clarified what they were trying to do... I would have asked if they really intended for Kok to go inside... or was it just overboard teasing."" When asked how he would have stopped the men, Maj Huang said that as a superior, ""your words are command"" and he believes the men would have listened to the order. On the night of the tragedy, Maj Huang was at home when he received a call at around 9pm from Chong. ""I can't remember his exact words, but it was along the lines of Kok fell into the kolam and they cannot find his body,"" he said, adding that he was ""puzzled"" at why Cpl Kok was in the pump well and probed further. ""Kenneth said they were trying to suck out water to find him.

When he reached the station, he saw paramedics administering CPR to Cpl Kok. He also noticed that there was a fire engine near the pump well and equipment all over the place. From his interactions with Cpl Kok, Maj Huang said he was a ""good boy"" who followed instructions well and always tried his best. Recalling an incident where Cpl Kok was stressed over a mistake he had made during an audit, Maj Huang said Cpl Kok was still ""quite smiley"" when he spoke to the NSF about it. The trial continues in the afternoon where Chong and Nazhan's defence lawyers are expected to cross-examine Maj Huang. "

The 18-year-old, who is now a full-time national serviceman, was sentenced to 18 months' supervised probation on Thursday (June 13). Under the conditions of the supervised probation, Ong must remain indoors from 10pm to 6am, and perform 120 hours of community service. To address his sexual offending, he must also attend sessions by a psychologist on healthy sexuality and responsible sexual conduct, as well as avoid being left alone with a child aged 12 and below unless supervised by an adult. His parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour during the period of probation. Ong had approached the girl, who was walking past the lift lobby area of Block 233 Pending Road on her way home from school, at about 3.15pm on July 12 last year. He asked her to be his model for a photography competition, and the girl agreed. She went with him to the second-floor staircase landing of the block, and as she was going up the steps, Ong patted her buttocks lightly. He apologised, which led the girl to believe it was accidental, according to court documents. Later, Ong asked the girl for permission to touch her legs and adjust her pose, which she agreed. He held the girl's knees and pushed her legs apart. This caused the girl to feel uncomfortable and she closed her legs, but Ong tried to do it again. However, the girl refused to budge. Ong then touched her chest before the girl pushed him away and left. Once she was home, the girl told her parents about the incident and they took her to the police station to lodge a report. After he was identified and arrested, Ong admitted to using the photography competition as an excuse for the girl to follow him. He did not take any photos. He also claimed he had acted in a moment of impulse and regretted his actions afterwards. "

On Nov 6 last year, a resident of a third-storey unit at Block 18 Joo Seng Road heard sounds of sparklers. He saw sparks when he looked out of the window.

At about 10.30pm, the resident's mother called the police, reporting ""big fireworks"" that seemed ""very dangerous"". Following police investigations, it was found that Fernandez had bought a bundle of six whistling fire sparklers comprising six cylindrical tubes. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Mathias Tan urged the court to sentence Fernandez to a fine of between $2,000 and $3,000. In consideration of Fernandez's age and his being a first-time offender, District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim sentenced him to a minimum mandatory fine of $2,000.

Yesterday, Ramlan, 24, pleaded guilty to 14 charges of extortion, cheating and drug possession. He was sentenced to 6½ years' jail and 10 strokes of the cane, with effect from Oct 25 last year, when he was remanded. Fifty other similar charges were taken into consideration. The court heard yesterday that Ramlan had a profile on online classifieds website Locanto, where he advertised sexual services under female names such as ""Ellisha"" or ""Mariaa"". Those interested in procuring his services would send him a text message or call him on his mobile phone number, thinking that they were contacting a woman. Between March and October last year, he used the naked photos sent to him willingly by at least five victims to extort money from them. He did this on several occasions. The victims cannot be named because of a gag order. In one of the cases, a 22-year-old Singaporean man saw Ramlan's advertisement online and contacted him through WhatsApp on Sept 24 last year. During the conversation, the man sent Ramlan a naked photo of himself, and later, on Ramlan's suggestion, the pair did a video call. Deputy Public Prosecutor Zhou Yihong said: ""At the start of the video call, the victim still thought he was calling a female, as the accused looked like a woman on video."" The victim then agreed to pay Ramlan $55.55 to see the latter perform a sexual act. While the pair were doing so, the victim realised Ramlan was actually a man, said DPP Zhou. Later that day, Ramlan sent the victim a Facebook post with photos showing the victim's genitals and face, and said that if the victim did not transfer $90 to him, he would not take down the Facebook post. Fearing that the post could harm his reputation, the victim acceded to the request. Ramlan used the same tactic to extort a total of $3,110 from the man on 31 occasions between Sept 24 and Oct 22 last year, when the victim finally made a police report. The next day, Ramlan was arrested. During a police search, a packet of methamphetamine, or Ice, and an improvised plastic ware meant for the consumption of the drug were found in his possession.

And when the SCDF servicemen around them started saying ""kolam, kolam"" during a cake-cutting ceremony for Cpl Kok, Lance Cpl Mohamed Rabik said he saw the former give a ""scared smile"". The ""kolam"" ritual involved an officer being made to climb into the 12m-deep pump well at Tuas View Fire Station. Lance Cpl Mohamed Rabik said he and Cpl Kok were close and often together at the station. He was testifying yesterday on the third day of the trial of Lieutenant Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, and First Senior Warrant Officer Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40. The officers face charges over the death of Cpl Kok, 22, who drowned on May 13 last year during a ragging incident that saw him being pushed into the fire station's pump well, also known as kolam in Malay, as part of activities to mark the completion of his national service. On the night of the incident, Chong was rota commander and Nazhan, deputy rota commander. They are each charged with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. They allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the well, thereby endangering his life. Lance Cpl Mohamed Rabik said the ""kolam"" ritual was brought up during the celebration to mark Cpl Kok's impending operationally ready date. He noticed his friend was ""scared, but smiling"" and when the celebrations ended, Cpl Kok ""rushed"" to leave the control room. In Lance Cpl Mohamed Rabik's account, ""kolam, kolam"" was shouted in the room where most of the officers on duty, including Chong and Nazhan, had gathered. Chong's defence lawyer Wee Pan Lee asked him to clarify what he meant by shouting, and the SCDF officer said the words were spoken ""louder than normal"", but noted that many were talking and the room was noisy. Lance Cpl Mohamed Rabik said four officers, including himself, carried a ""resisting"" Cpl Kok towards the well located across the yard. He remembered Cpl Kok ""wriggling"" his body ""mildly"" and interpreted this as resistance. Mr Wee suggested that it was possible Chong did not hear anyone mention ""kolam"" as the room was noisy, and that whatever went on in the yard outside happened without his client's involvement. ""(Chong) worked with the men long enough to know he could trust them and not cause harm to each other,"" said Mr Wee.

In a police statement after the incident, Chong said he knew the group was taking Cpl Kok to the well only when he saw them gathered there, and acknowledged he failed in his duty as a supervisor to stop the act.

The decision on Wednesday (June 12) hinged on the court's conclusion that Mr Mohamed Yusoff Hashim was not an employee of the club but was instead an independent contractor. The court also cleared JCC of four criminal charges of non-payment of CPF contributions, overturning a district court decision last year to convict the club. Mr Yusoff started working as a gym instructor at the club in 1991. Up till October 1998, he was treated as an employee and JCC contributed to his CPF. In November 1998, he stopped receiving CPF contributions after his status was converted to that of an independent contractor. His employee benefits, such as paid annual leave, medical coverage and annual wage supplements, were also revoked. He continued to work at JCC under a series of contracts that were negotiated on an annual or biennial basis. In 2016, when he found out that JCC would be closing down, he asked the board whether he was entitled to employer's CPF contributions. The board decided that he was so entitled, leading to prosecution against JCC for alleged non-payment for four months between 2003 and 2016. The club, represented by Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim, fought the charges, contending that Mr Yusoff was not an employee at the relevant time. A district judge, however, concluded that Mr Yusoff was in fact an employee. JCC was  The prosecution then sought an order for the club to pay arrears in contributions plus interest amounting to $416,924, but this was denied by the district judge. JCC then appealed against conviction, while the prosecution appealed against the dismissal of its application for payment of arrears. In a 54-page judgment on Wednesday, Justice See Kee Oon said the evidence showed that JCC did not consider Mr Yusoff an employee, and neither did Mr Yusoff himself. ""It was clear that Yusoff entered into the contracts each time knowing that the result was that JCC would not make CPF contributions, but that he would have to do so as a self-employed person,"" he said. Mr Yusoff testified that he was shocked in 1998 when told about the change in his status, but accepted the arrangement. Justice See also addressed submissions by the prosecution that the case ""has wide implications on whether employers can, through contractual machinations, deprive employees of CPF contributions"". ""It is curious that Yusoff claimed only in 2016 that the clear terms of the contracts did not in fact reflect the true nature of their agreement, particularly in light of the substantive changes that had followed from the formal change in his status,"" he said. The judge said the facts suggest Mr Yusoff did have some bargaining power and the prosecution has not made the case that he was a victim of exploitative conduct. Justice See also set out the appropriate legal test for determining whether a particular person is an employee for the purposes of the CPF Act. He said the court should first look at the parties' intentions when entering into a contract, and then consider whether what is stated in the contract reflects the reality of the working relationship. If someone is labelled an independent contractor but the reality of the working relationship does not match up, the court should not hesitate to look behind the label, he said. In Mr Yusoff's case, Justice See listed various factors that pointed to an independent contractor relationship. This included how Mr Yusoff was not part of JCC's head count, was not subject to employee performance appraisal, and was allowed to train non-members at the JCC gym. Many of the factors the district judge relied on, such as how Mr Yusoff had to clock in and out of work, were neutral factors that did not point either way, he said. ""I conclude that the reality of the parties' working relationship was not at odds with the express intention for Yusoff to be an independent contractor."" ""This was mutually understood and accepted between the parties. There was no subterfuge on JCC's part."" "

In sentencing, district judge Marvin Bay said dangerous driving must be taken seriously and Pang's offence was ""especially egregious"". The judge noted that Pang had been caught using a phone while transporting an illicit cargo in a car he was driving without permission, and had then recklessly taken the police on a prolonged high-speed chase. ""Your heedless driving also resulted in near-misses with hapless motorists and you had gone on to attempt to flee by foot,"" said the judge. The court heard that Pang had been tasked by the hirer of the car to arrange for it to be returned to the rental company, but decided to use the vehicle instead. On the morning of Dec 3, 2017, he met someone called ""Ah Biao"" and collected a canvas bag containing 616 packets of assorted duty-unpaid cigarettes. Pang had paid $2,500 for the contraband, which he intended to resell for a profit. As he was driving home with the cigarettes in the boot, he used his mobile phone along the BKE towards the direction of Woodlands Checkpoint. Traffic Police Staff Sergeant Nazirul Haffiz Syed Nassir noticed that Pang had his phone in one hand, and the other hand on the steering wheel. The officer signalled him to pull over but he decided to flee. Pang almost hit another vehicle as he entered the Seletar Expressway towards the Central Expressway, and he then squeezed into the road shoulder, exiting into Woodlands Avenue 12. He continued to drive dangerously within Woodlands, beating red lights and driving against traffic . Pang had another near-miss before he finally stopped at a carpark in Woodlands Street 32. He got out of the car, pleaded with Staff Sgt Nazirul Haffiz to be lenient and took off on foot, but was caught a few blocks away. "

We tried to search for him, we dived in and dived out, but there was no sign of him,"" said Nur Fatwa, who had originally pushed Cpl Kok into the well during celebrations to mark his impending operationally ready date (ORD). When Cpl Kok - a Malaysian national and Singapore permanent resident - did not resurface, his colleagues drained the well but it took 36 minutes before they were able to pull him out. In a video of the incident shown in court, the group of servicemen crowded around the well are seen removing their boots.  Nur Fatwa said this was the moment when they started to panic because they realised that something was wrong.  He and four other officers took turns to try locating Cpl Kok, and it was only after the water on the well had been drained to Nur Fatwa's chest level did they realise that there was a smaller hole at the bottom.  ""I requested breathing apparatus because the water pressure made it difficult, it caused discomfort to my ears and breathing,"" said Nur Fatwa. He and and Staff Sergeant Ng Meng Kiat used breathing apparatus to dive into hole where the latter found Cpl Kok, pulled him to the surface and out of the well. They were each charged in July last year with aiding a rash act that caused grievous hurt by illegal omission. The duo had allegedly failed to prevent a group of servicemen from pressuring 22-year-old Cpl Kok to enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. They are contesting the charges. In October last year, Nur Fatwa  The staff sergeant pleaded guilty to pushing Cpl Kok into the pump well and also abetting the obstruction of justice when he told another officer to delete a video recording of the incident. On Tuesday, Nur Fatwa, who is currently serving his time on the Home Detention Scheme, told the court that he had mentioned the ""kolam"" ritual, which involved getting into the fire station's pump well, to Cpl Kok when they were taking attendance the morning of May 13. ""I recalled that someone told me that it was Kok's last day of duty. So I joked around with him, I said 'Today, kolam'."" He added: ""The kolam (ritual) is to celebrate an occasion, like a departure."" Nur Fatwa also said he remembered Cpl Kok smiling in response but could not recall whether he replied. Later that night, when most of the officers on duty - including Chong and Nazhan - had gathered in the control room for a cake-cutting ceremony in honour of Cpl Kok, Nur Fatwa said he brought up the kolam again. However, he did not remember whether Chong or Nazhan had heard this or responded to it. A few officers then carried Cpl Kok towards the pump well across the yard and put him on the ground. He said at one point when they were gathered at the pump well, he remembered Nazhan pointing to the edge of the well. Said Nur Fatwa: ""I recall he said that if you cannot swim, you should jump nearer the edge of the kolam."" He also said shortly after making the comment, Nazhan walked away from the group towards the station's admin room. The trial will resume in the afternoon, when Nur Fatwa is expected to be cross-examined by Chong's and Nazhan's lawyers. "

These were some of the last words uttered to full-time national serviceman (NSF) Kok Yuen Chin before he died. The exchange with fellow Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officer Adighazali Suhaimi was captured in video footage that was shown in court yesterday. Corporal Kok, 22, is seen smiling as he sits on the edge of the 12m-deep well filled with water. Adighazali, who has already been jailed for his role in the incident, also said in Malay: ""ORD pun kena terjun kolam"", which means ""ORD (operationally ready date) also must dive into the pool"". However, these statements were not meant to be taken literally, said Staff Sergeant Al-Khudaifi Chang at yesterday's trial, where two SCDF Rota commanders are contesting charges against them. On May 13 last year, Cpl Kok drowned after he was pushed into a pump well at Tuas View Fire Station as part of activities to mark the completion of his national service. Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, was station commander that night, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 41, a first senior warrant officer, was deputy commander. The two men were in court yesterday for the first day of their trial. <strong>Celebrations</strong> The first video shows full-time national serviceman Kok Yuen Chin sitting on the floor of the control room - also known as the watch room - in Tuas View Fire Station, with a cake in front of him. The mobile phone footage shows fellow officers joking around him and the 22-year-old giving a thank-you speech. Someone is heard saying ""kolam, te tap, kolam"", Malay for ""well still means well"", referring to the pump well. Corporal Kok is seen smiling and saying ""tak boleh, gitu"", which means ""cannot like that"". <strong>Towards the pump well</strong> The second video, taken from closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage in the station, shows the group of about 10 officers moving across the parade square towards the pump well. Some are carrying Cpl Kok, and they put him down in front of the well. At one point, they raise their hands. The court hears that this might be in response to Rota 3 Commander Kenneth Chong Chee Boon telling them not to film the incident, and they show him they do not have their mobile phones. <strong>The pump well</strong> In the third video, also from the station's CCTV footage, an officer is seen opening the metal gate around the pump well. Cpl Kok is carried to the opening and placed on the ground. Deputy Commander of Rota 3, Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, is seen with the group, but he does not stay for long and heads towards the station office. Cpl Kok is seen moving towards the well. <strong>The fall</strong> The fourth video, filmed from a mobile phone, shows a close-up of Cpl Kok standing barefoot and moving to sit on the edge of the well. Laughter is heard, and Cpl Kok also smiles. Someone is heard saying in Malay, ""Don't worry, Zac is around"". The court later hears that Zac, or Cpl Sok Leng, is known to be a good swimmer. All of a sudden, Cpl Kok is seen falling into the water. <strong>Tan Tam Mei</strong> They have each been charged with abetting a rash act that caused grievous hurt by unlawful omission. They allegedly failed to prevent a group of officers from making Cpl Kok enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. Cpl Kok, a Malaysian national and Singapore permanent resident, failed to surface after being pushed into the well. His colleagues drained the well, but it took 36 minutes before they pulled him out, and he had drowned. Staff Sgt Chang, who was on duty on May 13 last year, said yesterday that the night started with a celebration for Cpl Kok in the control room, where more than 10 officers, including Chong and Nazhan, had gathered. He told the court that SCDF regular Muhammad Nur Fatwa Mahmood, who has already been jailed for his involvement, said at the celebrations, ""well still means well"", to indicate that Cpl Kok would still have to enter the pump well. After cutting a cake and presenting a plaque to Cpl Kok, some of the officers grabbed the NSF and carried him towards the pump well. Staff Sgt Chang was one of them. ""I was thinking that we were just trying to scare him and not throw him in,"" he said, adding that at no point did anyone try to stop them. He said Nazhan followed the group to the pump well but did not stay with them for more than five minutes. He left and went to the fire station office. When they put Cpl Kok on the ground, he removed his personal belongings and took off his polo tee of his own accord, said Staff Sgt Chang. At one point, Chong stuck his head out of the nearby control room's window to tell them not to record any video of the incident. Four videos documenting the events leading up to Cpl Kok's death were shown in court. In one taken seconds before the fatal push, Cpl Kok is seen sitting on the well's edge laughing with the officers around him. Staff Sgt Chang said this was when the question of whether Cpl Kok could swim was raised, to which Cpl Kok said he could not. However, during cross-examination, Chong's lawyer, Mr Wee Pan Lee, tried to confirm if the exchange happened, as the question and response were not heard in the video. Staff Sgt Chang said the exch-ange was based on his ""memory of the incident"". Mr Wee asked: ""So, your memory of that is faulty, what else is faulty with your memory?"" He also asked if it was possible that Chong's position in the control room meant his view of the well could have been blocked and he might not have heard the noise outside. Staff Sgt Chang agreed. Nazhan's lawyer, Mr Singa Retnam, also established that the act of carrying Cpl Kok to the pump well was not under the direction of any of the commanders. The case resumes today, with Nur Fatwa among the witnesses expected to testify. In October last year, Nur Fatwa was sentenced to one year and four weeks in jail for pushing Cpl Kok into the well. The staff sergeant also abetted the obstruction of justice when he told Adighazali to delete a video recording of the incident. Adighazali, a staff sergeant, was given one month in jail last December for deleting the footage of Cpl Kok being pushed into the well. "

Muhammad Sofian Samsuddin also threatened to stab the 21-year-old man with a knife. Sofian, 25, was sentenced yesterday to three years and 16 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to two counts each of theft and drug-related offences. He also admitted to assault and criminal intimidation. The victim got to know Sofian's 27-year-old fiancee in early April last year via online dating application Tagged, and the pair began messaging each other on WhatsApp and Telegram. The woman later agreed to meet the man if he paid her $150 for sexual services. At around 1am one day some time later that month, they met at the void deck of a Bukit Batok block of flats, where they started hugging and kissing but did not have sexual intercourse. When the man refused to pay, Sofian's fiancee walked away and blocked him on WhatsApp. But the man sent her a message on Telegram on June 21 last year, and asked to meet again. She told him that they could meet for sex if he paid her $150. However, she decided to use this opportunity to confront him for not paying her in April that year. She met the man at a Boon Lay Drive playground at around 4.20am on June 22 last year and asked him to pay her $150. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Woon Yee said: ""In response, the victim said he only had $50 with him and suggested the pair should simply kiss and hug like the last time. ""The (woman) seemingly agreed to this and accepted the money from the victim. At the same time, she discreetly sent a text message to the accused, instructing him to come to the playground to assault the victim."" Sofian arrived soon after and the couple started punching the man's face before asking him to hand over the remaining $100. Sofian also threatened to stab him. The man told his attackers that he had to withdraw the cash from an ATM and Sofian's fiancee then asked him for his wallet, which contained items including $10 in cash and a bank card. The couple were escorting the man to an ATM at Boon Lay Community Club when he managed to run away to make a police report. The woman was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail earlier. Yesterday, the court heard that, while out on bail, Sofian consumed methamphetamine and stole a pair of Nike shoes from outside a flat in Teck Whye Lane. Sofian is now out on $20,000 bail and has been ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on July 1 to begin serving his sentence. "

Spa owner Nguyen Thi Hong Lan, 35, a Singaporean of Vietnamese descent, was convicted on Nov 5 last year of offences under the Immigration Act, and was also jailed for another eight weeks, in default of a $10,000 fine. Nguyen was arrested on Aug 15, 2017, and convicted of arranging a marriage of convenience between a Singaporean man and a Vietnamese woman. She was also convicted of abetting the man to make false statements to obtain visit passes for his ""foreign spouse"", said the ICA. Nguyen filed an appeal on Nov 29 last year against her conviction. It was dismissed on April 24 by the High Court and Nguyen began her jail term on May 8. The ICA said investigations revealed that Nguyen was approached in December 2016 by a Vietnamese woman, Duong Thi Anh Kieu, 34, who wanted to remain in Singapore to work. Nguyen suggested that Duong enter a marriage of convenience and told her to pay $20,000 for the sham marriage arrangements. Nguyen then suggested that Soh Sheng Chao, a 29-year-old Singaporean man, who was a delivery man in the shipping industry, enter the marriage of convenience as well. He would not have to fulfil any marital obligations but would have to sponsor Duong's visit pass and permanent residency applications. In return, Soh would be paid $6,000 as well as $300 for every successful visit pass extension. If Duong obtained permanent residency, Soh was promised another $3,000. Nguyen arranged for the pair to solemnise their ""marriage"" on Feb 9, 2017. Duong paid Nguyen $10,000, and $6,000 of the sum was given to Soh. Duong did not live with Soh but stayed and worked in a spa operated by Nguyen to pay off the remaining $10,000 that she owed. Nguyen also abetted Soh to make false statements in the visit pass applications for Duong. Soh was arrested by ICA officers on Aug 15, 2017, while Duong was arrested on Aug 19 the same year. Duong was jailed for six months on Oct 4, 2017, and Soh was jailed for four weeks on Jan 31 last year over the marriage of convenience and for making false statements in the visit pass applications. ICA said it takes a serious view of individuals trying to circumvent its system by engaging in, arranging or helping to arrange marriages of convenience to obtain immigration facilities in Singapore. If convicted, a person may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to 10 years, or both. <strong>Correction note:</strong> "

Muhammad Sofian Samsuddin also threatened to stab the 21-year-old man with a knife before following him to a nearby automated teller machine to withdraw more cash. Sofian, 25, was sentenced on Monday (June 10) to three years and 16 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to two counts each of theft and drug-related offences. He also admitted to assault and criminal intimidation. District Judge Marvin Bay said: ""This court takes a very dim view of your actions which can only be described as thuggish."" The victim got to know Sofian's 27-year-old fiancee in early April last year via online dating application Tagged and the pair began messaging each other on Whatsapp and Telegram. The woman later agreed to meet the man if he paid her $150 for sexual services. At around 1am sometime later that month, they met at the void deck of a Bukit Batok block of flats where they started hugging and kissing but did not have sexual intercourse. When the man refused to pay, Sofian's fiancee walked away and blocked him on Whatsapp. But he messaged her on Telegram on June 21 last year and asked to meet again. She told him that they could meet for sex if he paid her $150. However, the woman decided to use this opportunity to confront him for not paying her in April that year. Sofian, who was then with his fiancee, saw the messages and became angry when he realised that she was meeting the man to provide sexual services. The couple quarrelled and the woman told Sofian the next day that she wanted to confront the man, as he ""owed her money"". She met the man at a Boon Lay Drive playground at around 4.20am on June 22 last year and asked him to pay her $150. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Woon Yee said: ""In response, the victim said he only had $50 with him and suggested the pair should simply kiss and hug like the last time. The (woman) seemingly agreed to this and accepted the money from the victim. At the same time, she discreetly sent a text message to the accused, instructing him to come to the playground to assault the victim."" Sofian arrived soon after and the couple started punching the man's face before asking him to hand over the remaining $100. Sofian also threatened to stab him. The man told his attackers that he had to withdraw the cash from an ATM and Sofian's fiancee then asked him for his wallet which contained items including $10 cash as well as a bank card. The couple were escorting the man to an ATM at Boon Lay Community Club when he managed to run away. He lodged a police report at around 9.30pm that day and officers arrested the woman on June 28 last year. They arrested Sofian the next day. The woman was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail earlier. The court on Monday heard that, while out on bail, Sofian consumed methamphetamine and stole a pair of Nike shoes from outside a flat in Teck Whye Lane. Sofian is now out on bail of $20,000 and was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on July 1 to begin serving his sentence. For assault, he could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. He could have been jailed for up to three years and fined for each count of theft. "

In the incident on May 13 last year, 22-year-old Corporal Kok Yuen Chin drowned when he was thrown into a pump well at Tuas View Fire Station during a celebration to mark the completion of his national service. The two officers, Kenneth Chong Chee Boon, 38, a lieutenant, and Nazhan Mohamed Nazi, 40, a first senior warrant officer, were commander and deputy commander, respectively, of the station that night. The two men were in court on Monday (June 10) for their trial, which is expected to last two weeks. The regulars were each charged in July last year with aiding a rash act by illegal omission that caused grievous hurt. The duo had allegedly failed to prevent a group of servicemen from pressuring Cpl Kok to enter the pump well, thereby endangering his life. Three other regulars were also charged for their involvement, and two have been dealt with in court. <a href=""https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scdf-nsf-who-died-was-renting-boon-lay-flat-with-girlfriend-planned-to-work-as-security"" target=""_blank"">Cpl Kok, a Malaysian national and Singapore permanent resident</a> When he did not surface, his colleagues drained the well. It took 36 minutes before they were able to pull him out, but he had drowned. During Monday’s trial, staff sergeant (SSgt) Al-Khudaifi Chang, who was on duty on the night of the incident, was the first witness called to the stand.  In recounting the incident, the hazmat specialist said that at no point before the incident did anyone try to stop the ragging.   “During the whole time,  no one told us to stop and no one mentioned the word ‘stop’,” said SSgt Chang.  He said Chong and Nazhan were present during the cake-cutting ceremony in the control room before the pump well incident . There were more than 10 people in the room.   According to him,  SCDF regular Muhammad Nur Fatwa Mahmood, who has already been jailed for his involvement, had said in Malay, “Well, still means well”, to indicate that Cpl Kok would still have to enter the pump well. After the cutting of the cake and presentation of a plaque to Cpl Kok, some of the officers grabbed the NSF and carried him towards the pump well.  SSgt Chang was one of the men who helped to carry Cpl Kok to the pump well.  He said that Nazhan walked with the group from the control room towards the pump well but did not stay with them for more than five minutes. He left and went to the fire station office.  “ I was thinking that we were just trying to scare him and not throw him in, “ said SSgt Chang. He said that when they reached the well, Cpl Kok removed his personal belongings and took off his polo tee on his own accord.  At one point, Chong stuck his head out of a window in the nearby control room to tell the group not to record any video of the incident.  “We all raised our hands to show that we did not have our handphones on us,” said SSgt Chang.  SSgt Chang said that before the incident, Cpl Kok had told him in a private conversation that he could not swim.   When Cpl Kok was sitting on  the edge of the pump well, the question of whether he could swim was raised. Cpl Kok responded to say that he could not swim,  SSgt Chang said. But the answer was dismissed as there was an SCDF officer present whom the group believed was a good swimmer and could dive into the well to save Cpl Kok if needed, he added.  During the trial, the prosecution also showed four videos documenting the events leading up to the point when Cpl Kok was pushed into the pump well.  In one of the videos that was taken seconds before the fatal push, Cpl Kok is seen sitting on the edge of the pump well laughing and joking with the officers around him..  The trial will resume in the afternoon, when the defence is expected to cross-examine SSgt Chang.  In October last year, Nur Fatwa, 34, was sentenced to one year and four weeks' jail for causing death by rash act. The staff sergeant admitted to pushing Cpl Kok into the pump well, which resulted in his drowning, and also abetting the obstruction of justice when he told another officer to delete a video recording of the incident. Adighazali Suhaimi, 33, a staff sergeant, was sentenced to one month's jail  last December for deleting the video footage of Cpl Kok being pushed into the pump well. "

Liaw Tick Kwan, 37, made unauthorised transfers, lied about investments and used their money for himself, including buying real estate in Cambodia under his wife's name. He pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating last month. He also admitted to one count each of an offence under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act and of dealing with the benefits of his criminal activities. The court heard that Liaw was working for DBS Bank between November 2011 and May 2014 when he got to know the two Singaporean victims. In August 2013, Liaw helped Mr Chin Tian Loke, 73, to open a DBS account to invest in foreign currencies and applied for Internet banking facilities on his behalf. Mr Chin entrusted his online banking security token and personal identification number with Liaw for the younger man to manage his investment-related transactions. The following month, Liaw used the token to access the retiree's account - without his authorisation - and transferred US$83,000 to Mean Chey International Investment in Cambodia. In May and October 2014, he transferred US$19,000 from Mr Chin's account to that of his other victim, 67-year-old Ms Chou Ching Ping. Liaw went on to work for Standard Chartered Bank Singapore (SCB) from June 2014 to May 2015. He continued to act as Mr Chin's relationship manager and asked him to transfer all his money to SCB, which the victim did. On Oct 29, 2014, Liaw duped Ms Chou into believing she had received over $67,000 in her DBS account that was ""related to one of his client's investments"", the court heard. Ms Chou withdrew the amount and gave it to him. On March 9, 2015, Liaw duped Mr Chin into signing a cheque for more than $24,000. Liaw encashed it and spent the money. In May that year, Mr Chin became suspicious, checked with SCB and found out he had been cheated. He then lodged a police report. Deputy Public Prosecution Norman Yew said Liaw had made partial restitution. Between July and September 2015, he paid more than $24,000 to SCB, and last April, he handed over US$10,300 to Mr Chin. "

In enhancing the sentence meted out to Low Song Chye, the High Court laid down sentencing guidelines for cases of voluntarily causing hurt - an offence which carries a maximum of two years' jail. In his written judgment, Justice See Kee Oon devised three sentencing bands based on whether the harm caused was low, moderate or serious. Those who commit offences involving low harm, with no visible injury or with minor hurt such as scratches and abrasions, will face indicative sentences ranging from fines or short jail terms of up to four weeks. At the other end of the scale, assailants who cause serious injuries that are permanent or require significant surgical procedures will face indicative jail terms of between six months and two years. The sentences will be adjusted depending on relevant factors specific to each offender. In the current case, Low had claimed trial to causing hurt to Ms Guang Man by slapping her face and ear, and grabbing her neck, in the early hours of July 12, 2016, at a MacPherson Road karaoke pub. Ms Guang - whose job included singing, drinking and inducing customers to buy flower garlands - had gone to the pub's office to collect her salary, as it was her last day of work. However, she was dissatisfied with the amount offered and refused to accept the money. After exiting the office, she picked up some balls from a pool table and threw them around. Ms Guang testified that Low had grabbed her neck and slapped her with ""very great force"" on the left side of her face and her left ear, and told her to stop throwing tantrums. Low, who was responsible for security at the pub, denied assaulting her. His version of events was that he had gone up to Ms Guang to stop her from throwing the pool balls, but she had become aggressive. He said his hand had come into contact with her cheek - but that he had used ""not that great"" a force - as he was pushing her away. A medical examination found that Ms Guang's left eardrum was perforated. Low was found guilty by a magistrate's court last year and sentenced to 12 weeks' jail. He was also ordered to pay Ms Guang $800 in compensation. He appealed against the conviction, sentence and the compensation order, while the prosecution appealed for a harsher sentence. Yesterday, Justice See said Low's case fell into the moderate harm category and that four months' jail was appropriate, considering his past violence-related antecedents. However, the judge said: ""While the accused's actions were certainly disproportionate and unwarranted, there was also an element of provocation by the victim."" Low's appeals were dismissed. "

On April 28, 2018, a 47-year-old man insulted a police officer and bumped him with his head and shoulder during a routine spot check along Yishun Ring Road. On Oct 27, 2018, a 20-year-old woman held a police officer in a choke-hold by his neck and pushed him while he was attending to a dispute along Orchard Road. On Nov 15, 2018, a 29-year-old man slapped and verbally threatened a parking warden carrying out parking enforcement duty along Jurong East Central 1. On Dec 22, 2018, a 55-year-old man hurled vulgarities at a National Environment Agency enforcement officer when he was being issued a summon for smoking at a prohibited area along Jurong East Central 1. On Jan 20 this year, a 36-year-old man pushed and hurled vulgarities at a parking warden who was carrying out parking enforcement duty along Pandan Loop. On Feb 12 this year, a 51-year-old woman assaulted two auxiliary police officers who were deployed for Active Mobility Enforcement with the Land Transport Authority along Stirling Road. Those convicted of using abusive language against a public servant can be jailed for up to 12 months, fined up to $5,000, or both. If found guilty of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty, they can be jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned, or a combination of the punishments. Using criminal force against a public servant is punishable with a jail term of up to four years, a fine, or both. In the statement, the police said that they have zero tolerance towards acts of violence against public servants who are carrying out their duties, and they will not hesitate to take action against those who disregard the law.

In enhancing the sentence meted out to Low Song Chye, the High Court laid down sentencing guidelines for cases of voluntarily causing hurt, an offence which carries a maximum of two years' jail. In his written judgment, Justice See Kee Oon devised three sentencing bands based on whether the hurt caused was low, moderate or serious. Those who commit offences involving low harm, with no visible injury or minor hurt such as scratches and abrasions, would face indicative sentences ranging from fines or short jail terms of up to four weeks. At the other end of the scale, assailants who cause serious injuries that are permanent or require significant surgical procedures would face indicative jail terms of between six months and two years. The sentences would be adjusted depending on relevant factors specific to each offender. In the current case, Low had claimed trial to causing hurt to Ms Guang Man by slapping her face and ear and grabbing her neck in the early hours of July 12, 2016 at a MacPherson Road karaoke pub. Ms Guang, whose job included singing, drinking and inducing customers to buy flower garlands for her, had gone to the office at the pub to collect her salary as it was her last day of work. However, she was dissatisfied with the amount offered and refused to accept the money. After exiting the office, she picked up some balls from a pool table and threw them around. Ms Guang testified that Low grabbed her neck and slapped her with ""very great force"" on the left side of her face and her left ear, and told her to stop throwing tantrums. Low, who was responsible for security at the pub, denied assaulting her. His version was that he went up to Ms Guang to stop her from throwing the pool balls but she became aggressive. He said his hand came into contact with her cheek with ""not that great"" force as he was pushing her away. A medical examination found that Ms Guang's left eardrum was perforated. Low was found guilty by a magistrate's court last year and sentenced to 12 weeks' jail. He was also ordered to pay Ms Guang $800 in compensation. He appealed against the conviction, sentence and the compensation order, while the prosecution appealed for a harsher sentence. On Thursday, Justice See said Low's case fell into the moderate harm category and four months' jail was appropriate, considering his past violence-related antecedents. However, the judge noted: ""While the accused's actions were certainly disproportionate and unwarranted, there was also an element of provocation by the victim."" Low's appeals were dismissed. Justice See noted that $800 was ""too modest"" and the magistrate did not explain how he arrived at the sum, but said he would not interfere as the prosecution has not appealed against the compensation.

Liaw pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating last month. He also admitted to one count each of an offence under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act and one of dealing with the benefits of his criminal activities. The court heard that the accused was working for DBS Bank between November 2011 and May 2014 when he got to know his two Singaporean victims who relied on the money from their accounts as their source of income. In August 2013, Liaw helped Mr Chin Tian Loke to open a DBS account to invest in foreign currencies, and applied for Internet banking facilities on the 73-year-old's behalf. Mr Chin entrusted his online banking security token and personal identification number with Liaw so that the younger man could manage his investment-related transactions. The following month, Liaw used the token to access the retiree's account - without his authorisation - and transferred US$83,000 (S$105,000) to Mean Chey International Investment in Cambodia. In May and October 2014, he transferred more than US$19,000 from Mr Chin's account to that of his other victim Chou Ching Ping, 67. Liaw went on to work for Standard Chartered Bank Singapore (SCB) from June 2014 to May 2015. He continued to act as Mr Chin's relationship manager and asked him to transfer all his money to SCB, which the victim did. On Oct 29, 2014, Liaw duped Ms Chou into believing that she had received more than $67,000 in her DBS account that was ""related to one of his client's investments"", the court heard. Believing Liaw, Ms Chou withdrew the amount and gave it to him. On March 9, 2015, Liaw duped Mr Chin into signing a cheque for more than $24,000 after lying to the retiree, claiming that he had to pay some fees. Liaw then encashed the cheque and used the money for his personal expenses. In May that year, Mr Chin became suspicious after receiving no updates from SCB, and discovered that he had been cheated after checking with the bank. He lodged a police report soon after. Deputy Public Prosecution Norman Yew said Liaw has made partial restitution. Between July and September 2015, he paid more than $24,000 to SCB, and in April last year, he handed US$10,300 to Mr Chin. For each count of cheating, Liaw could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

Former cleaner Manickam Pragasam, 58, helped launder over $1 million of nearly $40 million in criminal proceeds from the scam that targeted SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), which oversees an initiative aimed at promoting lifelong learning. He was sentenced to two years and nine months' jail after pleading guilty to three money-laundering charges involving nearly $900,000. Two other charges linked to the remaining amount were taken into consideration during sentencing. Under the SSG scheme, a Singapore business entity sending an employee for skills training courses with registered training providers can apply to SSG for a subsidy, provided certain conditions are met. Depending on the claim method used, subsidies are payable to either the training provider or the business entity. The syndicate used nine Singapore-registered firms in the scam.

The court heard that Lau called Prosperbiz Petroleum's bunker clerk Lim Puay Kwang, 41, asking him to lie to the Malaysian authorities and say that the pirates had hijacked MT Joaquim while it was sailing towards Langkawi to deliver cargo to a firm called Siam Gulf Petroleum. In reality, MT Joaquim was on its way back to Singapore. Worried that Singapore's Police Coast Guard (PCG) might also question them about the illegal purchase of the crude oil, the pair met Prosperbiz's director Chew Hoe Soon, 55, at a Beauty World Plaza eatery on Aug 10, 2015, where the trio agreed to lie to the police. It was not revealed in court documents what Lau had originally intended to do with the oil, or how Singapore-registered Prosperbiz was linked to him. Lau gave the false information to Station Inspector Sivaprakash Damohdaran at the Central Police Division the next day, while Lim and Chew lied to the PCG later that month. All three Singaporeans retracted their false statements about three months later, the court heard, though it was not revealed why. Chew was earlier sentenced to two weeks' jail, while Lim was fined $3,000. The MT Joaquim was found off Pulau Rupat in Indonesian territorial waters. Separately, Lau was found to have more than twice the limit of alcohol for driving when he was stopped by police in Kallang Road at around 4am on Feb 13 this year. He had earlier drunk six glasses of beer. He had committed a similar offence in 2011. Lau was also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for three years yesterday.

The sum is based on a 2007 legal costs bill due from the estate of her late mother-in-law, Madam Lim Lie Hoa, who died in 2009 at age 74. Mrs Ong applied for the estate's executor, Mr Ong Siauw Ping, to be examined in court to determine how best to get the money, and this was allowed by High Court assistant registrar Jonathan Ng. This is the first such reported case where the court has made clear that an estate's executor is liable to be examined in court over debts to be recovered from the estate. It is also a significant milestone for Mrs Ong, 57, who has been unyielding in her fight for a share in the estate of her father-in-law, Mr Ong Seng Keng, a prominent Indonesian businessman who died in a 1974 accident. She separated from his son Ong Siauw Tjoan in 1987, but lived with their three children in a North London bungalow bought by her mother-in-law. In 1991, she began a series of legal battles with her mother-in-law for a share of Mr Ong Seng Keng's estate. In 2005, Madam Lim legally forced the family out of the London home before selling it for £3.2 million a year later. She died four years later, leaving behind a series of court orders against Mrs Ong in relation to the house. But these orders have been set aside or stayed after a London court found in 2015 that Madam Lim had lied to the Singapore courts in 2004 when she denied creating a trust for the house. A lengthy appeal process in London, by the executor of Madam Lim's estate, against the 2015 judgment ended in failure in the British Supreme Court last year. That meant Mrs Ong no longer owed Madam Lim 19 years of rent - calculated in 2007 to be £2.3 million. Mrs Ong had applied to the London court to declare that there was a trust. Although she is not one of the beneficiaries, she stands to profit from Mr Ong Siauw Tjoan's share in the house under divorce proceedings. Her children are entitled to a 60 per cent share of the sale proceeds. Mrs Ong's first success had been in 1996 in a Singapore court, which ordered an inquiry to determine the size of the family's estate to assess her share. She was awarded $3.2 million as a result of a 2002 inquiry by a High Court assistant registrar. But the subsequent bill of costs awarded to her following the inquiry - a sum of $738,819.15 - remained unpaid as it was meant to offset the £2.3 million in unpaid rent she owed Madam Lim. However, the 2015 London court decision in her favour cancelled the unpaid rent owed - a change that meant the $738,819.15, with interest, was payable to her by Madam Lim's estate. Mrs Ong's lawyer Andrew O'Hara had argued that court rules allow for an executor to be examined as the executor can convert the assets of the estate to cash and is duty-bound to pay off the dead person's debts. He referred to Mr Ong Siauw Ping's statement that there had been no distribution from Madam Lim's estate ""save for settling legal fees incurred in the litigation for and on behalf of (her) estate"". As of May 7 this year, the sum plus interest owed which Mrs Ong seeks to recover was $968,622.60, including over $9,000 in costs awarded to Mrs Ong in relation to a court hearing in February. "

Mr Abu Samad Omar, 62, who had been suffering from ischaemic heart disease, had collapsed suddenly at his workplace and died later in hospital in 2017. The case threw up a key issue for the court's decision in relation to work accident compensation under the relevant law: Did Mr Samad succumb because of his medical condition or was the death an accident that arose ""out of and in the course of his employment""? Compensation would be payable to his next of kin under the latter situation but not if the sole cause was his medical condition. The Manpower Ministry had in October 2017 assessed that $181,421 was payable as compensation to Mr Samad's next of kin but the insurers of the employer, Colex Environmental, objected. NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative claimed his death was caused by his medical condition and not caused or aggravated out of and in the course of his employment. The matter went before the Assistant Commissioner for Labour who dismissed the next of kin's case as they failed to show the ""causal link"" between the heart attack and Mr Samad's employment. On the fateful morning of July 19, 2017, Mr Samad, after reporting to work, had breakfast with three colleagues who later went to a shed to remove wheels from green refuse bins. After about 30 minutes, Mr Samad went to help them unscrew the wheels of a bin. All of a sudden, he collapsed. His next of kin, represented by lawyers Kelvin Tan Sia Khoon and Sara Ng, appealed to the High Court where Justice Chan Seng Onn held, among other things, that ""the question in dispute is whether the accident (that is, the heart attack) arose out of and in the course of the deceased's employment"". He found, after reviewing the circumstances, the accident ""clearly arose in the course of his employment"". In judgment grounds issued on Wednesday, the judge noted that under the Work Injury Compensation Act, it is presumed the accident arising in the course of the employment shall be deemed to have arisen out of that employment, unless rebutted. ""As a result, the heart attack arose out of the deceased's employment,"" the judge ruled. Justice Chan, in reviewing the evidence, found the presumption had not been rebutted. He said there was inadequate evidence to show Mr Samad's heart condition was the sole cause of his death, noting the three colleagues corroborated that he was exerting himself before the heart attack. The judge also noted the medical evidence did not show it was ""unlikely"" the strain would have triggered the heart attack. If so, then the employer and insurer, defended by lawyer Appoo Ramesh, would have succeeded in their claim. Justice Chan made clear the burden was on the employer to show the heart condition was the sole cause of his death and that it was not for the claimants to show there were work-related events strenuous enough to trigger Mr Samad's heart condition. ""This fundamental misunderstanding... is a substantial error of law on the part of the Assistant Commissioner,"" said Justice Chan. The judge described the mood of that morning in July 2017 before Mr Samad collapsed as ""jovial"". "

Prosecutors said all four items were later found to have traces of methamphetamine.

Ler's statement was taken by CNB officer Gan Cher Kiat, who told the court that the accused claimed to have used the syringe found on him to flush out food particles from between his teeth. Ler is currently serving a two-year sentence for helping his HIV-positive American partner, Mikhy Farrera-Brochez, deceive the authorities into issuing a pass for him to work here.

Doris Tan Stephenson, who used to be known as Clara Tan Lisin, made the investment decisions alone and there was no indication of whether she met the minimum competency requirements, a district court heard yesterday. The investors later lost more than $700,000, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Magdalene Huang. The investment scheme, known as the Capital Multiplying System (CapMS), was conceptualised in 2013 by Tan, director of Singapore-based CTL Group and also CTL Global, which was incorporated in the United States. Later that year, CTL Group marketed the scheme offered by CTL Global to at least 29 investors in Singapore. Tan, 43, was sentenced to 12 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to nine counts of offering the investment scheme without authorisation from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). She also pleaded guilty to nine counts of offering the scheme without a prospectus. The case involved the first prosecution of such offences, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Khoo. Tan also admitted to a single charge of running a business dealing with securities without a capital markets services licence from the MAS. DPP Huang said that as part of the CapMS scheme, the investors' monies were pooled together to buy a group of properties in the US. Profits would be generated by authorising CTL Global to perform tasks such as acquiring, selling and leasing these properties to tenants. But the investors failed to receive their promised returns and 10 police reports were filed against CTL Group here. Yesterday, defence lawyer Jonathan Cho told District Judge Ng Peng Hong: ""My client herself sustained quite a significant loss, losing $3 million of her own."" He also said Tan had been betrayed by the people she trusted and that one of the alleged parties was her attorney in the US, Mr Scott C. Cole. Mr Cho added: ""Even the most unlikely person - her US attorney - committed fraud behind her back by embezzling all her company's money, and (then) disappeared. All he left our client with was a huge burden to bear, and problems that were not even caused by her to begin with."" The court heard that there is now a civil suit in the US between Tan and the law firm allegedly linked to money that had been embezzled. "

Grace Quek Xin Hui, 23, was sentenced yesterday to a year and nine months' probation and ordered to perform 130 hours of community service. She must also remain indoors from 10pm to 6am every day and undergo counselling to address her anger management issues. Each parent was bonded for $5,000 to ensure her good behaviour. Quek had pleaded guilty in court on May 2 to one count each of assault, rioting and criminal intimidation. The other members of her group - Jamie Thng Yu Xuan, 20; Ang Pek Ling and Gina Yeo Kai Ting, both 21; and Tey Shi Hui, 22 - were dealt with in court earlier. Quek and her group were having drinks at Envy Dance Club in St James Power Station at around 3am on Dec 15, 2017, when Yeo told the others that the 19-year-old victim, identified as Ms Ng, had kissed the boyfriend of one of Yeo's friends. That friend was not part of the group, the court heard. Thng, a friend of the victim, contacted her at around 4am and said she needed to meet her outside Club Viva, a nightspot located nearby. But Thng did not go alone. She was accompanied by other members of the group.

""When Ms Ng denied this, Jamie and the rest of the group... slapped, kicked, punched Ms Ng and pulled her hair... At one point, Quek also pulled Ms Ng by her hair to the ground, held a lighter near Ms Ng's face, and threatened to burn her face and hair."" A passer-by helped the victim escape her attackers, and she sought refuge in another club. In the meantime, Quek and her group spotted one of Ms Ng's friends, a Ms Loke, 21, and asked her about the teenager's whereabouts. DPP Kaur said: ""When Ms Loke replied that she did not know, the group got angry (and) started slapping, kicking and punching Ms Loke, and pulled her hair.""

Ler Teck Siang, who is 38 this year, is accused of providing ""slamming"" services, the street slang for administering illegal substances by injection. Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Wuan said Ler was so proficient at it that word spread and reached the ears of Sim Eng Chee, who engaged his services. ""This is a case of a medical practitioner who knows no bounds in betraying his professional and ethical standards in pursuit of his self-interests,"" added the DPP. The former head of the Health Ministry's National Public Health Unit is on trial over two drug-related offences. Ler is accused of administering methamphetamine, also known by its street name Ice, to Sim in a hotel room at Swissotel The Stamford on Feb 26 last year. He is also charged with possessing utensils intended for drug use in the Conrad Centennial Singapore hotel lobby on March 2 last year. Another charge of failing to provide a urine specimen to a Central Narcotics Bureau officer was stood down for this trial. The prosecution team, comprising DPP Wuan and DPP Desmond Chong, said yesterday that they will set out to prove that Sim was introduced to Ler for his ""slamming"" services some time in the second half of 2017. At that point, Ler was already facing charges of abetment for cheating and giving a false statement to a public servant. He was charged in court over these offences related to the HIV data leak, which involved his American partner Mikhy Farrera-Brochez, in June 2016. Prosecutors said Sim had engaged Ler's ""slamming"" services on a number of occasions, and had done so last year on Feb 26, and again on March 2. On March 2, the hotel staff discovered drugs and drug-related paraphernalia in Sim's hotel room, and the authorities arrested Ler and Sim after they were called to the scene, said prosecutors. The authorities also found a syringe, two straws and a bottle on Ler. When questioned why he had these items with him, Ler said that he ""is a doctor"", and that he used them for himself, a former hotel security staff member, who was present on March 2, testified in court. But traces of methamphetamine were found on the items, the prosecutors said in their opening statement. ""When the law finally caught up with him, the accused showed no remorse, and even tried to use his status as a doctor to protest his arrest,"" said the prosecutors. Ler, who is representing himself in the trial, was convicted of cheating-related offences last September. He is serving a two-year jail sentence for helping his HIV-positive partner Farrera-Brochez cheat the authorities into issuing him a pass to work here. Ler had submitted his own blood sample in place of Farrera-Brochez's so that the American could pass medical tests to work here. Farrera-Brochez had obtained the names, addresses, contact details and medical information of some 14,200 HIV-positive people before leaking them online. Ler, who was head of the National Public Health Unit between March 2012 and May 2013, also faces a charge under the Official Secrets Act for failing to take reasonable care to retain possession of the information regarding the HIV-positive people. His medical registration has been suspended for nine months following his conviction for cheating. The trial related to the drug offences continues today. Sim's case has been dealt with separately in court. "

Mr Low was interviewed at the office of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) on Tuesday evening. He also surrendered his passport yesterday as part of the police probe, said Allied Technologies in an update filed with the Singapore Exchange. CAD had also on Tuesday taken away information, records and documents relating to Allied Technologies and its subsidiaries - Asia Box Office, Activpass Holdings and Allied Technologies Holdings - from the premises of Allied Technologies and its subsidiaries. These seizures also relate to the escrow account with JLC. ""CAD has not disclosed to the company any further details of its investigation. The company intends to cooperate fully with CAD on the investigation,"" said Allied Technologies in the statement. The $33.2 million reported missing was held in escrow by law firm JLC for the Catalist-listed engineering firm Allied Technologies. The money was believed to have been paid out on the instructions of Mr Jeffrey Ong, the law firm's managing partner, and the payouts might have been unauthorised. JLC said last week it was investigating the matter and had lodged reports with the authorities. Allied Technologies said that despite repeated demands for repayment since March 23, including a letter of demand issued by its lawyers from Rajah & Tann on May 17, JLC has failed to release the balance funds of $33,153,416.56 and has breached its obligations under the escrow agreement inked on Oct 23, 2017. The Law Society took control of the clients' accounts of JLC last week and have also started an investigative audit on the law firm. JLC's managing partner Jeffrey Ong has remained uncontactable since. Allied Technologies recused Mr Low and two other directors from all decisions and recommendations by its board because of conflict of interest in relation to the missing $33.2 million held by JLC. The other two recused independent directors are Ms Karen Pok Mee Yau, who is a salaried partner of JLC Advisors, and Mr Lim Jin Wei, who has been a signatory to the escrow account with JLC. Meanwhile, JLC has asked its appointed lawyers from Advocatus Law to look into Allied Tech's letter of demand dated May 17 seeking the return of the money and a further letter from Allied's Rajah & Tann lawyers received last week.

In a written judgment released on Monday, Justice Choo Han Teck said the siblings have brought a ""strange matter"" to the High Court. ""The court is not where one goes to for permission to keep pets,"" he added. The dispute began when the plaintiff, Madam Rosaline Goh, 64, wanted to move back into the house with her two dogs, a nine-year-old golden retriever and a seven-year-old labrador. The original owner of the house in 61 Kovan Road, Madam Loh Gek Huay, had bequeathed the two-storey bungalow to her 10 children and one grandson. However, the defendants and occupants of the house, Mr Goh Lian Chyu, 77, and his wife, did not allow Madam Goh to bring her dogs into the house as they felt the animals were dangerous and dirty. Justice Choo noted that none of the siblings was quarrelling with the point that Madam Goh was entitled to live in the maternal home if she wanted to, as stipulated by Madam Loh's will. He said when Madam Loh died in 2002, her will had stated that the executor ""shall permit my children above named or any one of them to occupy the same rent free so long as he or she shall desire"", and she had meant exactly that. ""So I am left with the small issue of the dogs. The defendants object to the dogs moving in to the house with the plaintiff because they consider the dogs dangerous and dirty,"" the judge said. But a person who has a right to live in a house also has the right to decide what she brings along with her, he noted. ""The court is not a dog-licensing authority,"" he added, stating that as a lawful occupant, Madam Goh was entitled to such pets as are allowed by the relevant authorities. ""There is... no necessity to make a formal judicial declaration since from my reasoning here, it will be obvious to the parties that there is presently no impediment to the plaintiff moving in with her two dogs,"" Justice Choo said. ""It seems more likely that it is the human siblings who are going to tear each other apart,"" he added, noting that the siblings had rejected the suggestion to sell the house, each taking their share of the inheritance and living peacefully apart from the other siblings.

The man, known only as Collins, did not tell Christina Cheong Yoke Lin that the money was the proceeds of a love scam inflicted on another woman. Cheong, 63, felt suspicious but did not alert the police when Collins told her to pass $50,000 to ""one of his boss' associates"". Instead, she ignored Collins' instructions and decided to keep the money. The Singaporean pleaded guilty yesterday to dishonestly misappropriating cash. The court heard that she knew Collins through an online dating platform, Badoo, in early August 2017. She told him that she was in debt and he then asked if she would allow his boss' associates to make use of her bank accounts. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong said: ""Collins explained that the accused could take $500 out of each transaction and bring the rest of the money to Johor Baru, Malaysia."" Cheong agreed to ""try out"" the arrangement. The court heard that a 54-year-old victim of a love scam transferred $50,030 to Cheong's bank account on Aug 17, 2017. Collins then told Cheong to pass $50,000 to one of his boss' associates, but she decided to keep the money instead. On Aug 21, 2017, Cheong transferred $31,000 to a Malaysian bank account to help a man with whom she was in love. The man, known only as Mark Anthony, was also a scammer who had told her that he was purportedly detained by the Malaysian authorities. The prosecutor said: ""As for the remaining $19,000, from Aug 18 to Sept 4, 2017, the accused spent $1,000 on her own expenses and transferred the remainder to various foreign bank accounts over several occasions pursuant to the instructions of one 'Chong Lee', who had promised to give the accused $800,000 for her help as part of an inheritance scam."" Cheong was caught after the 54-year-old Singaporean woman linked to Collins' love scam alerted the police on Sept 22, 2017. Defence lawyer Yu Kexin told the court yesterday that Cheong has made full restitution. Ms Yu urged District Judge Ng Peng Hong to call for a report to assess her client's suitability for a mandatory treatment order (MTO), saying that Cheong was suffering from major depressive disorder when she committed the offence. Offenders given an MTO have to undergo treatment for their mental conditions in lieu of jail time.

In Australia, he had a sexual relationship with a boy aged below 16 from January 2004 to October 2005. He had met the youth in an online chatroom for teenagers, and told him he was 19. They had sex multiple times. On one occasion, he met the boy in the home of his parents-in-law where he set up a tripod and a video recorder in front of the bed. In another incident, he showed the teenager 14 pictures of boys in Asia. ""He told him he had sex with them and they were all 12 to 14, because any younger and he would be taking advantage of them,"" Ms Breckweg told the court. The court also heard that the German police had referred Kunsevitsky's case to their Australian counterparts in 2008, but the Australian victim involved was identified only in 2016. Kunsevitsky was arrested on Sept 4, 2017, when he returned to Australia. When questioned by the police at the airport about images on his phone showing him having sex with a child, he said he never engaged in sexual acts with children, Ms Breckweg said. But the police found more evidence of his crimes in multiple electronic devices among his belongings that were shipped from Singapore. Kunsevitsky has since been dubbed one of Australia's worst sex offenders. He is in remand in Australia, awaiting sentencing. "

Toh Guang Yi, 22, had been placed on a supervision programme for drug consumption but had thrown away his electronic ankle tag in a bid to evade the authorities when he was stopped by the officers in Bukit Batok. A scuffle ensued as he tried to escape, and he left one with a cut lip and the other with a dislocated right arm, but they still managed to subdue him with the help of passers-by. Toh was sentenced to five years and three months' jail with three strokes of the cane on Wednesday (May 29) after pleading guilty to drug consumption, mischief, assaulting a policeman and using criminal force on the other. Toh was sentenced to four years of reformative training in March 2016 for his earlier drug offence. But in April last year, he was placed on a ""release on supervision programme"" and issued with a radio-frequency identification tag strapped to his left ankle. Around three months later, Toh cut off the strap and threw away the tag, which cost more than $300. He had consumed methamphetamine shortly before Staff Sergeant Lee Jun Xiang, 28, and Special Constable Sergeant Yap Wei Xuan, 19, spotted him while patrolling around Bukit Batok Central on the evening of Sept 15 last year. They conducted a check on Toh but he claimed he did not have his wallet with him, before eventually giving them his brother's details. Toh gave the wrong date of birth, and when the officers tried to search him, he became aggressive and fled. The policemen caught up with him and when they tried to subdue him, he flung Sgt Yap's arm away, dislocating it, then punched Staff Sgt Lee in the face. Passers-by went to the officers' aid and helped to subdue Toh. For assaulting a policeman, Toh could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined or caned. "

The conflict arose when Ow Foo Wah, 53, learnt that Mr Paul Ow Wai Hou, 25, had withdrawn about $8,000 from his bank account without authorisation last July. It was later learnt that the money was used to settle debts with unlicensed moneylenders. Ow, a shipping agent, pleaded guilty to assault on Wednesday (May 29). The court heard that he confronted his son in their Jurong West flat on Sept 8 last year and asked him when he would repay the amount. A scuffle broke out when Mr Paul Ow refused to answer. Deputy Public Prosecutor Asoka Markandu told the court: ""The accused then reached out for a knife which was underneath a table to try and stab the victim. ""When the victim pushed the accused away, they again got into another scuffle and in the course of the altercation, the accused stabbed the victim once in his abdomen."" The court heard that Ow immediately stepped away when he spotted blood on his son's hand. Ow's 26-year-old daughter attended to her brother's injuries and called the police. Mr Paul Ow was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital where he was treated for a 1cm stab wound on the right side of his abdomen and scratch marks on his arms. He was discharged two days later. The DPP told District Judge Tan Jen Tse: ""The accused admitted that he had used a knife during his dispute with the victim. ""The dispute arose because the accused was upset with the victim for borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders and for using his credit card without his authorisation.""

On Wednesday (May 29), the police said that in such scams, a scammer would first take control of a victim's WhatsApp account. They would then post a fake screenshot of a WhatsApp account verification code request in a chat group that the victim was in, under the pretence of alerting the members of the group to WhatsApp takeover scams. At the same time, the scammer would attempt to log in to the WhatsApp accounts of the chat group's members, causing them to each receive WhatsApp verification codes on their own device. The scammer would do this to try and trick the group members into posting screenshots of the verification codes they received in the group chat, under the belief that they were also experiencing the same ""takeover scam"". Once a group member posted his code in the chat, the scammer would use it to take control of his account. Noting that such scams have been reported overseas, the police advised members of the public not to share their WhatsApp account verification codes with anybody, and to beware of unusual requests received over WhatsApp, even if they were sent by one's WhatsApp contacts. Members of the public who receive such requests should call their friends to verify their authenticity, but should not do so using WhatsApp, as their friends' accounts may have been taken over by scammers. The police said that WhatsApp users can protect their accounts by enabling the ""Two-Step Verification"" feature, which can be found under ""Account"" in the ""Settings"" tab of the application. In the event that someone has their WhatsApp account taken over by a scammer, they can recover it by signing into the app using their phone number and verification code, which will be sent to their phone. Doing this will also cause the scammer who has taken over the account to be automatically logged out. Members of the public who wish to provide any scam-related information may call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit the information online at  "

The man, known only as Collins, did not tell Christina Cheong Yoke Lin that the money was the proceeds of a love scam perpetrated on another woman. Cheong felt suspicious but did not alert the police when he told her to pass $50,000 to ""one of his boss' associates"". Instead, she ignored Collins' instructions and decided to keep the money for herself. The 63-year-old Singaporean pleaded guilty on Wednesday (May 29) to dishonestly misappropriating the cash. The court heard that she knew Collins through an online dating platform, Badoo, in early August 2017. She told him that she was in debt and he then asked if she would allow his boss' associates to make use of her bank accounts. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong said: ""Collins explained that the accused could take $500 out of each transaction and bring the rest of the money to Johor Baru, Malaysia. ""After asking why the money could not be paid directly into his boss' account, and if she would get into trouble for carrying 'lots of money', the accused agreed to 'try out' the arrangement."" The court heard that a 54-year-old victim of a love scam transferred $50,030 to Cheong's bank account on Aug 17, 2017. Collins then told Cheong to pass $50,000 to one of his boss' associates but she decided to keep the money. DPP Ng said: ""From Aug 18 until Aug 27, 2017, Collins asked the accused repeatedly about the money but the accused kept making excuses and ignoring his WhatsApp voice calls. ""Finally, on Aug 27, 2017, Collins fell out with the accused and called her a 'thief' via WhatsApp... Thereafter, the accused ignored several WhatsApp messages and voice calls from Collins before blocking him."" On Aug 21, 2017, Cheong transferred $31,000 to a Malaysian bank account as she wanted to help another man with whom she was in love with. However, the man, known only as Mark Anthony, was also a scammer who had told her that he was purportedly detained by the Malaysian authorities. The DPP said: ""As for the remaining $19,000, from Aug 18 to Sept 4 , 2017, the accused spent $1,000 on her own expenses and transferred the remainder to various foreign bank accounts over several occasions pursuant to the instructions of one 'Chong Lee', who had promised to give the accused $800,000 for her help as part of an inheritance scam."" Cheong was caught after the 54-year-old Singaporean woman linked to Collins' love scam alerted the police on Sept 22 that year. Court documents did not state the outcome of the case involving Collins. Defence lawyer Yu Kexin told the court on Wednesday that Cheong has made full restitution. Ms Yu urged District Judge Ng Peng Hong to call for a report to assess her client's suitability for a mandatory treatment order (MTO), saying that Cheong was suffering from major depressive disorder when she committed the offence. Offenders given an MTO have to undergo treatment for their mental condition in lieu of jail time. Judge Ng has called for the report and Cheong, who was offered bail of $25,000, will be back in court on June 26. For dishonestly misappropriating the money, she can be jailed for up to two years and fined. "

In the first case of its kind here, the Singapore branch of LT Sambo was charged with one count of an offence under the Air Navigation Order. The firm, which used to be known as Sambo E&C, is expected to plead guilty on June 18. The court heard that LT Sambo operated a small unmanned aircraft outdoors ""in the course of business"" without a Class 1 activity permit, along Marine Parade Road on Nov 17, 2017. Court documents did not reveal the details behind the firm's alleged use of the drone, which was identified as a DJI Phantom 4 and weighed 1.3kg. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) stated on its website that a Class 1 activity permit is needed for activities involving unmanned aircraft that are ""not recreational or research in nature"". The CAAS added that such situations include competitive unmanned aircraft races held by private organisers and businesses providing aerial surveying or photography services. A Class 1 activity permit is not valid without an unmanned aircraft operator permit, which is also granted by CAAS. The operator permit is granted to applicants if they are able to ensure they operate the drones safely. For recreational and research purposes, permits are not required for drones 7kg and below, including payload, and if they are flown outside prohibited areas, and at an altitude not exceeding 200 feet above mean sea level. The CAAS said that given Singapore's busy airspace and densely populated urban environment, the flying of an unmanned aircraft must be carried out in a ""safe and responsible manner"". It added: ""If not carried out properly, the operation of unmanned aircraft may pose a risk to aviation and public safety."" First-time offenders convicted of flying a drone without a Class 1 activity permit can be fined up to $20,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to 15 months and fined up to $40,000. <strong>Correction note: </strong> "

Yesterday, the 39-year-old part-time musician was sentenced to 10 years' jail and given six strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to a charge of statutory rape. Two other charges, one each of statutory rape and sexual penetration of a minor, were taken into consideration. The offences took place between the night of Sept 22 and the morning of Sept 23 in 2015. The father of three cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity. A repeat drug abuser, he is currently serving a 7½-year term for drug consumption. His jail term for the sexual offences will start in December 2020, after he completes his current sentence. The High Court heard that the man has known the victim since she was seven years old; her mother has been in a long-term relationship with his elder brother. Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew said the relationship between the accused and the girl was akin to one between an uncle and a niece. The two became closer in mid-2015 and would often chat over the phone. On Sept 21, 2015, the girl ran away from home and a missing persons report was lodged. The girl's mother, the accused and the accused's brother eventually found her and told the police. The girl did not want to go home with her mother and instead accompanied the accused, who had said he was going to a fast-food restaurant for supper. However, the accused and the girl went off somewhere else and became uncontactable. On the afternoon of Sept 22, police officers found both of them near Bukit Gombak and called the victim's mother. The accused assured her over the phone that the girl was safe with him and he would take her home. The woman then told the officers to let the pair go. That night, the accused, who was then 35, took the girl to his office and had beer with her before they engaged in sexual acts. The next morning, he had sex with her again at the office. Meanwhile, the girl's mother made a police report against the accused. The brother of the accused went about looking for him and was shocked to find the pair drinking beer together at the office. He also suspected that sex was involved after noticing love bites on the girl's neck. The sexual acts came to light after the girl was taken to a police station for an interview. Pleading for leniency, the recently divorced accused said it was his first sexual offence. "

His lifelong exposure to gambling started at the age of six, when he helped with his father's illegal gambling operation in Malaysia. To feed his gambling addiction, the Perak-born Ewe turned to a life of crime, pocketing $40 million from various clients over a decade. Yesterday, prosecutors sought 30 years' jail for the 65-year-old Singapore permanent resident, given the ""phenomenal"" sum taken and his high degree of culpability. The defence argued for a term of 12 to 18 years, saying he had fully cooperated with the police. Justice Chan Seng Onn adjourned the case and is expected to give his sentencing decision in July. Ewe is out on bail of $1 million. Ewe was the managing partner of accounting firm Ewe, Loke & Partners, and a director of E&M Management Consultants, which provided financial consulting and corporate restructuring services. He siphoned money from 21 companies he was supposed to liquidate, including six subsidiaries of Hewlett-Packard (HP), and one company whose bank accounts he was managing. He also embezzled the assets of an individual in his role as a receiver. Ewe had control over the bank accounts and assets of the clients so that he could make payments to creditors or recover any assets. Instead, he transferred the assets into bank accounts that had him as an authorised signatory. Between February 2002 and July 2012, he used the funds to feed his gambling habit, settle debts or reinstate amounts he had siphoned off. To cover his tracks, he moved funds between the various entities. But his wrongdoings were uncovered after the HP group chased him about the assets from the liquidation of the companies. In March, he was convicted of 50 charges of criminal breach of trust as an agent. The story of how Ewe's ""association with gambling had dogged him all his life"" - in the words of his lawyer, Senior Counsel Michael Khoo - emerged yesterday. Ewe helped his father collect betting slips when he was as young as six. He worked as a croupier at Genting Highlands Resort after completing secondary school in Penang, and also in Newcastle, England while he was studying accountancy. In the early days of his career in Singapore, Ewe started gambling on cruise ships and later at the two resort casinos. As his losses mounted, Ewe first sold his apartment - and then he helped himself to clients' money. A defence psychiatric report said his addiction ""took a life of its own and clouded his judgment"". Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi said Ewe had a permanent hotel room on Sentosa and usually wagered $150,000 because he did not feel the kick with smaller bets. While he did not amass riches from his crimes, he led a high life that he could not have afforded otherwise. The DPP argued that a jail term of 30 years was in line with precedents. These include the cases of former Singapore Airlines supervisor Teo Cheng Kiat, who was jailed 24 years for siphoning $35 million from his employer, and former Asia Pacific Breweries executive Chia Teck Leng, jailed 42 years for swindling four banks of $117 million. But Mr Khoo urged the court to consider the cases of Setho Oi Lin, jailed 12 years for duping 1,341 people into paying about $37.5 million for fake memberships, and accounts clerk Richard Tiang, jailed 18 years for embezzling $46 million.

In a written judgment released on Monday (May 27), Justice Choo Han Teck said the siblings have brought a ""strange matter"" to the High Court. ""The court is not where one goes to for permission to keep pets,"" he added. The dispute began when the plaintiff, Madam Rosaline Goh, 64, wanted to move back into the house with her two dogs, a nine-year-old Golden Retriever and a seven-year-old Labrador. The original owner of the house in 61 Kovan Road, Madam Loh Gek Huay, had bequeathed the two-storey bungalow where she had lived to her 10 children and one grandson. However, the defendants and occupants of the house, Mr Goh Lian Chyu, 77, and his wife, had not allowed Madam Goh to bring her dogs into the house as they believe the dogs are dangerous and dirty. Justice Choo noted that none of the siblings are quarrelling with the point that Madam Goh is entitled to reside in the House if she wants to, according to Madam Loh's will. He said when Madam Loh, who died in 2002, declared that the executor ""shall permit my children abovenamed or any one of them to occupy the same rent free so long as he or she shall desire"", she meant exactly that. ""So I am left with the small issue of the dogs. The defendants object to the dogs moving in to the House with the plaintiff because they consider the dogs dangerous and dirty,"" added Justice Choo. He said a person who has a right to move into a house also has the right to decide what she brings along with her. ""The court is not a dog licensing authority,"" he added, stating that as a lawful occupant, Madam Goh is entitled to such pets - as do the defendants - as allowed by the relevant authorities. ""There is, therefore, in my view, no necessity to make a formal judicial declaration since from my reasoning here, it will be obvious to the parties that there is presently no impediment to the plaintiff moving in with her two dogs, Govi and Lap,"" Justice Choo added. Elaborating on his decision, Justice Choo said that ""I am comforted in ruling as I do because I think the dogs will probably be the most benign occupants in the house"". ""It seems more likely that it is the human siblings who are going to tear each other apart,"" he added, noting that the siblings had rejected the suggestion to sell the house, each taking her share of the inheritance and living peacefully apart from the other siblings. ""So now they have to live with each other. True misery is what we create for ourselves. ""If the parties here can see what's coming, from the acrimony so obvious in their affidavits, they have to make peace quickly - or else sell the House."" He ordered the parties to bear their own legal costs. <iframe height=""480"" src=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vaUwdEOBEo4GMkkcrmncjYOP3G2MUes0/preview"" width=""100%""></iframe> "

Before handing down the sentence, District Judge May Mesenas said that the teenager had committed a serious offence and that, had he been above 21 years old, he could have been sentenced to jail with caning. The judge also noted that even though three years had passed, the situation has still not improved between the teenager and his parents. She told him : ""I hope... there will be some closure to this."" The court heard that the teenager had been living with his grandfather since Nov 18, 2016. Court documents did not state the reasons for this arrangement. Prior to that, Dylan Loy had been asking his father for money, claiming that he needed $3,000 to pay for Uber rides as part of a ""survey"". Mr Loy, 49, then transferred $1,000 to his son's bank account. After spending the money, Dylan Loy asked his father for the remaining $2,000 but Mr Loy refused to give him any more cash. On Nov 29, 2016, the teenager asked his grandparents for the money at around 6am but they also rejected his request. He then armed himself with a steak knife that had an 8cm-long blade and went to his father's flat in Bishan. Mr Loy was leaving his home at around 8.30am that day when he spotted his son hiding beside a shoe cabinet. Dylan Loy confronted his father and demanded to know why he did not give him the money. He pushed Mr Loy, who had warned his son not to touch him. The teenager then got hold of his father's key pouch and flung it towards a drain along the corridor. As Mr Loy tried to retrieve it, his son took out the knife and attacked him. Mr Loy's neighbour, who heard the commotion and saw the scuffle, alerted the police. An ambulance took Mr Loy to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was found to have multiple stab wounds. He was discharged two days later and given hospitalisation leave until Dec 18, 2016. Dylan Loy intends to appeal against his sentence and was offered bail of $20,000. For causing grievous hurt with a weapon, offenders can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned. "

On Tuesday (May 28), the 39-year-old part-time musician was sentenced to 10 years' jail and six strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to a charge of statutory rape. Two other charges, one each of statutory rape and sexual penetration of a minor, were taken into consideration. The offences took place between the night of Sept 22 and the morning of Sept 23 in 2015. The man, a father of three, cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity. A repeat drug abuser, he is currently serving a 7½-year term for drug consumption. His jail term for the sexual offences will start in December 2020, after he completes his current sentence. The High Court heard that the man has known the victim since she was seven years old; her mother has been in a long-term relationship with his elder brother. Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew told the court that the relationship between the accused and the girl was akin to one between an uncle and a niece. The two became closer in mid-2015 and would often chat over the phone. On Sept 21, 2015, the girl ran away from home and a missing persons report was lodged. The girl's mother, the accused and the accused's brother eventually found her and told the police. When the officers arrived, they told the woman to take the girl to the station the next day for an interview. During this time, the girl told the accused that she did not want to go home with her mother. The accused then claimed he was going to a fast-food restaurant for supper and when the girl also said she was hungry, her mother told her to follow the accused to McDonald's and wait there. However, the accused and the girl went off somewhere else and became uncontactable. On the afternoon of Sept 22, police officers found the pair near Bukit Gombak and called the victim's mother. However, the accused assured her over the phone that the girl was safe with him and he would take her home. The woman then told the officers to let the pair go, saying that she trusted her future brother-in-law. That night, the accused, who was then 35, took the girl to his office. They drank beer before engaging in sexual acts. The next morning, he went out for more beer and had sex with the girl again at the office. Meanwhile, the girl's mother made a police report against the accused. The accused's brother went looking for him and was shocked to find the pair drinking beer together at the office. He also suspected that sex was involved after noticing love bites on the girl's neck. The sexual acts came to light after the girl was taken to a police station for an interview. Pleading for leniency, the recently divorced accused said it was his first sexual offence. "

In the first case of its kind here, the Singapore branch of LT Sambo was charged with one count of an offence under the Air Navigation Order. The firm, which used to be known as Sambo E&C, is expected to plead guilty on June 18. The court heard that LT Sambo operated a small unmanned aircraft (UA) outdoors ""in the course of business"" without a Class 1 activity permit, along Marine Parade Road on Nov 17, 2017. Court documents did not reveal the details behind the firm's alleged use of the drone, which was identified as a DJI Phantom 4 and weighed 1.3kg. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) stated on its website that a Class 1 activity permit is needed for activities involving UA that are ""not recreational or research in nature"". The CAAS added that such situations include competitive UA races held by private organisers and businesses providing aerial surveying or photography services. A Class 1 activity permit is not valid without a UA operator permit which is also granted by CAAS. The operator permit is granted to applicants if they are able to ensure the safe operation of the drones. For recreational and research purposes, permits are not required for drones 7kg and below, including payload, and if they are flown outside prohibited areas, and at an altitude not exceeding 200 feet above mean sea level. The CAAS said that given Singapore's busy airspace and densely populated urban environment, the flying of a UA must be carried out in a ""safe and responsible manner"". It added: ""If not carried out properly, the operation of UA may pose a risk to aviation and public safety."" First-time offenders convicted of flying a drone without a Class 1 activity permit can be fined up to $20,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to 15 months and fined up to $40,000. <strong>Correction note: </strong> "

Aszrul Mohd Yusoff, 39, had pleaded guilty earlier this month to 18 cheating charges involving nearly $652,000. Another 115 counts of cheating linked to the remaining amount were considered during sentencing. His 41-year-old wife, Husniyati Omar, who masterminded the scam, was jailed for seven years and nine months last September after pleading guilty to 20 cheating charges and one count of criminal breach of trust. Her offences involved nearly $1.8 million in all. Before yesterday's sentencing, District Judge Edgar Foo said the case involved a large sum of money and many victims. He also noted that Aszrul had made no restitution. Husniyati had asked a friend to set up Carpentry Design Works in early 2016, knowing that contracts in such businesses often required substantial upfront payments. She then asked Ms Christina Wong Hoi Khay, 24, to be its sole director and shareholder as the couple were undischarged bankrupts. However, the firm and its bank accounts were managed by the couple at all times. Aszrul was the firm's project director while his wife was in charge of sales and securing new customers. In April 2016, they opened an office and showroom in Telok Kurau Road and another in Yishun Industrial Street 1. A Facebook page for Carpentry Design Works was also set up and the couple enticed home owners into hiring them - although they had no intention of honouring the agreements they made. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Goh said: ""Only partial works such as hacking, carpentry works and installation of air-conditioning units were carried out... When the victims grew anxious, as their intended deadline for the completion of the renovation works loomed, they would contact the accused, who would claim that the renovation works would be completed after further payments were made."" The victims, caught in a bind, frequently made additional payments. But the renovation works set out in their agreements would not be carried out, said the DPP. The couple also cheated their subcontractors and did not pay for their services. The offences came to light when a subcontractor alerted the police in April 2017. Defence lawyer R. Dilip Kumar had earlier told Judge Foo that the couple have seven children aged between three and 20. The court heard that with both parents now behind bars, the four youngest children are in foster care while their older siblings are living with relatives. "

Yesterday, Quek, 69, was fined $7,000 and disqualified from driving for five years after pleading guilty to causing his wife's death by negligent driving. State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam said in an inquiry last year that there was no evidence of foul play, and she found Madam Ng's death to be ""an unfortunate traffic misadventure"". District Judge Ng Peng Hong told Quek yesterday: ""It is indeed unfortunate that this accident had taken place. I have no doubt it has taken a toll on you."" At around 7pm on April 25, 2017, Madam Ng, then a senior deputy director at the Ministry of Manpower's foreign manpower management division, had driven to Ang Mo Kio to meet her sister and some mutual friends to discuss their upcoming trip to China.

He then got back into the car. The chain of events turned tragic just as Madam Ng, who was in the front passenger seat, alighted from the car. Deputy Public Prosecutor Asoka Markandu said: ""The vehicle then started to move in reverse gear while the front passenger door was still open. The reverse movement of the car caused the door to hit (Madam Ng), who was standing on the road, and the impact made her fall to the ground.""

Both women were still in the lift when it abruptly dropped. Ms Chan immediately shouted for help and a deliveryman who was nearby helped to call the police. Madam Zarimah was pronounced dead at 4.40pm that day. The state coroner ruled that Madam Zarimah was killed after she fell and her head got caught between the frame of the cage and the lift landing.

In handing down the acquittal, the Court of Appeal said the prosecution had failed to establish that Adili Chibuike Ejike knew that the drug bundles in his suitcase were in his possession. The three-judge court, led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, disagreed with the prosecution that Adili had been ""wilfully blind"" to the existence of the drugs. Even if the Nigerian had taken reasonable steps to check the contents of his suitcase, he would not have discovered the drugs, which were found only when the inner lining was cut open by the authorities, said the court. ""Wilful blindness"" is a legal term to describe a person deliberately shutting his eyes to the truth, and entails that had he opened his eyes, he would have seen it. The court ruled that someone is wilfully blind if it is proved that he had a clear and grounded suspicion, that he had reasonable means of inquiry, and that he deliberately refused to pursue the inquiry. In November 2011, Adili, who was 28 at the time, arrived at Changi Airport with a small suitcase. After an X-ray scan showed an area of darker density, immigration officers cut the inner lining of the bag, revealing two bundles. These were later found to contain 1.96kg of Ice. Adili, who was unemployed, said a childhood friend in Nigeria had agreed to give him some financial help if he delivered the suitcase together with some money to an unspecified person in Singapore. The trial focused on his knowledge about the contents of the suitcase, as both the prosecution and the defence agreed that he was in possession of the drugs. The defence argued that Adili did not know the bundles of Ice were in the suitcase. The prosecution's case was that he had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The prosecution argued that the circumstances surrounding Adili's task were extremely suspicious and he was wilfully blind by failing to find out what he had been tasked with delivering. At the end of Adili's trial, a High Court judge had rejected his testimony and found him guilty. Adili appealed against his conviction and death sentence. Yesterday, in a written judgment, the apex court said the focus of the case should really be whether Adili was, as a matter of law, in possession of the drugs. This was because ""possession"" in this context required not just physical custody but also knowledge. The court said a person must know about the existence of a thing before he can be said to ""possess"" it in a legal sense. The prosecution's argument that Adili was wilfully blind implies that it accepts that he did not actually know of the existence of the drugs, said the court. Therefore, the prosecution cannot invoke the presumption of possession in this case. What is left is for prosecutors to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Adili had been wilfully blind to the existence of the hidden drugs, said the court. ""However, it is clear to us that a person opening the case and checking through its contents would not have been able to discover the drug bundles, which were eventually found hidden within its inner lining,"" said the court.

Husniyati asked a friend to set up Carpentry Design Works in early 2016, knowing that contracts in such businesses often required substantial upfront payments. She then asked Ms Christina Wong Hoi Khay, 24, to be its sole director and shareholder, as the couple were undischarged bankrupts. However, the firm and its bank accounts were managed by the couple at all times. Aszrul was the firm's project director while his wife was in charge of sales and securing new customers. In April 2016, they opened an office and showroom in Telok Kurau Road and another in Yishun Industrial Street 1. A Facebook page for Carpentry was also set up and the couple enticed homeowners into hiring them - although they had no intention of honouring the agreements they made. Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Goh said: ""Only partial works such as hacking, carpentry works and installation of air-conditioning units were carried out... When the victims grew anxious, as their intended deadline for the completion of the renovation works loomed, they would contact the accused, who reassured the victims that the renovation works would be completed after further payments were made."" The victims, caught in a bind, frequently made additional payments. However, the renovation works set out in their agreements were still not carried out, said the DPP. The couple also cheated their subcontractors and did not pay for their services. The offences came to light when a subcontractor alerted the police in April 2017. Defence lawyer R. Dilip Kumar had earlier told Judge Foo that the couple have seven children aged between three and 20. With both parents behind bars, the court heard that the four youngest children are now in foster care while their older siblings are living with relatives. For each count of cheating, Aszrul could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. Court documents did not state whether action will be taken against Ms Wong. "

One of the trio is independent director Karen Pok Mee Yau, who is a partner at the law firm. Allied Tech's board, which filed the announcement with the Singapore Exchange yesterday, has also lodged a police report requesting an investigation into JLC Advisors and its managing partner Jeffrey Ong Su Aun for potential offences committed. Mr Ong, 42, had allegedly made unauthorised payouts totalling $33,153,416 from the escrow account. The lawyer has been uncontactable for several days. In its announcement, Allied Tech said it was acting on the recommendation of its nominating committee in recusing Ms Pok, Mr Kenneth Low Si Ren and Mr Lim Jin Wei. Mr Low, who is the executive director, is involved in transactions relating to Platform Capital Asia (Singapore) and Asia Box Office (ABO). ABO is an e-commerce ticketing platform that Allied Tech invested in last year. Mr Lim, an independent director, has been a signatory to the escrow account with JLC since its establishment. The board said in the statement that the three directors shall not act as signatory to the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. ""The recused directors will continue to cooperate and assist in investigations,"" it added. The company also said it had on May 23 - through its lawyers from Rajah & Tann - asked JLC to provide a statement of accounts of the escrow funds, confirmation as to when it discovered that the monies had been paid out and to whom, as well as an update on the whereabouts of Mr Ong. ""The company has not received any reply from JLC to its letter,"" Allied Tech said. The announcement of a police probe came after the news last Friday of two investigations by the Law Society and the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo). The Law Society has taken control of all client monies held by JLC Advisors and is carrying out an investigative audit of the clients' accounts at JLC. It will inquire into all facts and circumstances surrounding the operation of the accounts and the role played by Mr Ong. At the same time, SGX RegCo has directed Catalist-listed Allied Tech to expand the scope of its upcoming special audit of the company to include developments surrounding the missing funds and the progress of its attempts to recover the money. SGX RegCo's new directive ensures that Allied Tech's special auditor will consider the latest developments in its investigations. The alleged missing $33 million from the law firm's client account exceeds some $22.6 million in total that went missing in cases involving six lawyers who have absconded from 1997 to 2007. "

In a statement yesterday, the police said that several victims reported in January and February that they were approached by the woman, who had claimed to operate a gold brokerage firm. She allegedly said the company was selling gold at a discounted price. The victims were then directed to make bank transfers of between $261,000 and $3.54 million, purportedly for buying gold. However, Lan allegedly did not fulfil the purchase orders after the payments were made. Officers from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division identified her through follow-up investigations and an arrest was made on Wednesday.

Nurul Natasha Sazali, 23, was yesterday sentenced to eight months' jail for repeatedly slashing Madam Fatimah Kalanthar Mastan, 68, in a Bukit Batok flat on Dec 15 last year. Madam Fatimah suffered injuries that included wounds on her back and left forearm. She was warded for two days and given hospitalisation leave until Dec 31 that year. Despite this, she has since forgiven her daughter-in-law, the court heard. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong quoted a letter by Madam Fatimah saying she has fully recovered and ""does not have any anger"" towards her daughter-in-law. Nurul is now out on bail of $15,000 and will begin serving her sentence on June 7. She is still married to Madam Fatimah's son Ahmad Haji Shahrul Hameed, 25, who agreed to be her bailor. The court heard that at around 10.30pm on Dec 15 last year, Mr Ahmad asked his mother to talk to his wife, whom he suspected of having an affair with another man. Court documents did not state if Nurul, who is jobless, had indeed been unfaithful to her husband. The DPP told District Judge Ong Chin Rhu that while Nurul was giving Madam Fatimah a massage in the room, her mother-in-law confronted her. She asked Nurul if her son was ""not good enough for her"" and if ""one husband was not enough for her"". Madam Fatimah then left her room to go to the living room. Nurul, enraged by her words, followed her and punched her a few times in the face, causing her lip to bleed. After that, Nurul went to the kitchen and took a chopper with a 17cm-long blade to slash her mother-in-law. ""The victim tried to take the chopper away from the accused while the accused continued to slash at her. The victim managed to grab hold of the chopper eventually and tossed it aside,"" said DPP Ng. Madam Fatimah ran out of the flat and Mr Ahmad followed her before he alerted the police. She was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where she was hospitalised until Dec 18 last year. She did not suffer any permanent injuries, the court heard. Defence lawyer Aw Sze Min, who was assigned to the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, pleaded for Nurul to be jailed for six months, stressing that she has been accepted back into the family.

Shanmugam said yesterday. But Singapore cannot make exceptions for Malaysians who have been sentenced to death for their offences as it would undermine the rule of law here, he added. ""Let me be quite clear, it is not possible for us to do so, regardless of how many requests we receive,"" said Mr Shanmugam. He added that the Singapore Government will not intervene when there are no legal reasons to do so and when the courts have already imposed a sentence. ""It is not tenable to give a spe-cial moratorium to Malaysians, and impose it on everyone else, including Singaporeans who commit offences which carry the death penalty,"" said Mr Shanmugam. The death penalty is imposed because evidence shows it is an effective deterrent against drug offences, he added, stressing that ""we are not going to be deflected from doing the right thing for Singapore"". Mr Shanmugam revealed that his Malaysian counterpart, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Liew Vui Keong, who is the de-facto Law Minister, had spoken to Senior Minister of State for Law Edwin Tong and written to the Singapore Government over the case of Pannir Selvam Pranthaman. The 31-year-old Malaysian drug mule, who was convicted of importing 51.84g of heroin in 2017, is on death row here. He got a temporary reprieve after the Court of Appeal granted him a stay of execution on Thursday, a day before he was due to be hanged. Speaking at the Central Narcotics Bureau's workplan seminar at the Home Team Academy, Mr Shanmugam said Singapore will respond to Datuk Liew once the case is over, adding that some Malaysian ministers are ""ideologically opposed"" to the death penalty. ""And we have to respect that. At the same time, we do impose a death penalty in Singapore, and I expect that Malaysia will respect that condition as well,"" he said. Mr Shanmugam revealed that last year, almost 30 per cent of the drug traffickers caught here were Malaysians, and nearly 30 per cent of the heroin seized, by weight, was brought in by Malaysians. He added that one in five traffickers who brought in drugs above the threshold that brings the death penalty was also a Malaysian. ""How do we go easy on Malaysians in the face of these statistics? And if we did, what will it mean for the rule of law? ""It will become a joke if there is a request made and we go easy. That is not the way Singapore works,"" said Mr Shanmugam, adding that when he responds to Mr Liew, he will make three key suggestions to get to the root of the problem. First, he will request statistics on how many drug traffickers the Malaysian authorities pick up on their side of the border. ""I assume their border control is as good, (that) they have strict laws on drugs. I assume they have as much of a will and intention to enforce them as we do,"" he added. ""If they can make sure they arrest the traffickers before they come into Singapore, that helps them and it helps us. The traffickers do not have to face the death penalty - they can keep them in Malaysia."" Second, he will ask about efforts to catch drug kingpins who operate in Malaysia and are ""too scared to come into Singapore"", adding that both sides could cooperate effectively in this area. Third, he said it would be helpful if the penalties that Singapore imposes on drug traffickers are publicised widely among the potential drug trafficking groups in Malaysia, who are predominantly poor, less educated and Indian, and do so to earn ""a few hundred ringgit"". Mr Shanmugam said the drug trafficking situation, if dealt with, would benefit both countries, adding that a practical way is to address the social situation of the vulnerable in Malaysia. Pannir Selvam had applied for his death sentence to be stayed on the basis that he intends to mount a legal challenge against the rejection of his petition for clemency to President Halimah Yacob. A three-judge Court of Appeal that granted his request had noted that Pannir Selvam was told of the rejection and his execution date just one week in advance, which did not leave the prisoner much time to get legal advice on his options.

At the same time, the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) has directed Catalist-listed Allied Tech to expand the scope of its upcoming special audit of the company to include developments surrounding the missing funds held by JLC and the progress of its attempts to recover the money. These moves were announced yesterday in a joint statement by the Law Society and SGX RegCo. They come in the wake of $33,153,416, lodged in an escrow account with JLC, from which unauthorised payouts were allegedly made by Mr Ong, who has been uncontactable for several days. The latest action by the Law Society expands the intervention it made earlier this week, when it focused on Allied Tech's account at JLC and asked for information from other law firms about clients' money that JLC may be holding. The joint statement said that in carrying out the investigative audit on the clients' accounts at JLC, the Law Society will inquire into all the facts and circumstances surrounding the operation of the accounts and the role played by Mr Ong. Following its findings, the Law Society will issue the appropriate statements to its members and the public, the statement added. The Law Society also said in the statement that ""interventions of this nature due to reasonable suspicions of dishonesty are rare"". It added: ""Nevertheless, the Law Society does so where merited and appropriate to safeguard public interest and the integrity of the legal profession, including the vast majority of Singapore lawyers who carry out their duties with honesty, fidelity and responsibility."" The SGX RegCo's new directive ensures that Allied Tech's special auditor will consider the latest developments in its investigations. The SGX had previously ordered the company to appoint a special auditor to investigate the circumstances surrounding various funds flows and the placing of the $33 million with JLC under escrow. Following this week's revelations that the money is missing, SGX RegCo said the special auditor will report solely to regulator SGX. In addition, SGX RegCo is requiring Allied Tech to obtain as quickly as possible the release of the monies held with JLC and to place them with an escrow agent approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said the joint statement. The aim is to safeguard the cash and bank balances of Allied Tech. ""The outcome of the Special Audit will be made public and SGX RegCo will update the market on further actions thereafter,"" added the statement. In the joint statement, SGX RegCo also noted that Mr Ong resigned as a director of SGX-listed Annica Holdings on Mon-day and has been uncontactable since then. ""Given these developments, SGX RegCo will object to any future appointment of Ong as a director or executive officer of any SGX-listed company until SGX RegCo is satisfied that the above-mentioned matters have been satisfactorily resolved,"" the statement added. The SGX Regco, in its notice of compliance letter to Allied Tech, said it reserves the right to take disciplinary action against the company and/or relevant persons for breaches of the listing rules, including any failure to comply with requirements imposed by the SGX. JLC Advisors senior partner Vincent Lim said yesterday that the firm is investigating if Mr Ong made the payouts from the account on his own initiative or on the instructions or request of others. Several payouts were made over the period in question to different persons and entities, he added. ""There is no evidence at this time that there are any payouts to Mr Ong's own account or to any entity which to our knowledge was associated with him at that time."" "

Chin Ming Kam, 45, organised seminars to promote Maxim Trader, an international ""fund management"" scheme run by financial trading firm Maxim Capital, which collected more than $50 million from over 2,000 investors here before ceasing operations. Chin had 53 people directly under him who invested a total of about US$755,000 (S$1 million), and as a result he earned US$75,500 in commission for referring them to the scheme. However, in July 2015, investors received information that it would cease operating in Singapore, and later found they were unable to recover their investments or obtain returns. Police were alerted. Cases against two Singaporean alleged accomplices - Goh Seow Mooi, 60, and Andrew Lim Ann Hoe, 61 - are pending. The court heard that Maxim Trader allowed investors to delegate trading decisions to Maxim Capital. Investment packages ranged from US$1,000 to US$30,000, with investors promised 3 to 8 per cent monthly returns with a lock-in period of 18 months and a capital guarantee. There were no policies for refunds. Individuals who wished to invest would have to be referred by an existing investor via the Maxim Trader website, which required a referral ID to register. The court heard that Maxim Trader was promoted via seminars and events, and that Chin and Goh organised at least 13 such seminars between May 2014 and July 2015. Existing investors were invited to take along friends and other interested individuals. The total amount of losses directly attributed to Chin was unclear.

Allan Lam, who was with AXA Life Insurance, was also ordered to pay a penalty of $151,044 - three times the amount of taxes he evaded for the years of assessment 2013 and 2014. The court heard that some time in July 2015, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) requested Lam, 30, to carry out a self-review for his income tax declaration for 2013 and 2014. Before the review, Lam had declared a total income of $137,754, after deducting $11,000 for business expenses, for the year of assessment 2014. However, after the self-review, he adjusted the amount to $148,754, after taking into account a deduction of $287,320 in expenses. After requests from Iras, Lam provided a breakdown of the business expenses claimed. In the expenses breakdown for 2014, Lam included referral fees of $84,000 to three individuals, and forged 36 payments vouchers to support the false claims. However, investigations by Iras revealed that none of the individuals had referred any clients to Lam to buy insurance, nor did they ever receive any money or referral fees from him. Instead, Lam had used the personal particulars of the three individuals, who had bought insurance policies from him previously, to forge the payment vouchers. Other business expenses for both years of assessment were also found to be false. After the false claims were discovered, Lam tried to absolve himself from any wrongdoing by claiming that it was his ex-colleague who had assisted him to prepare the accounts and false expenses that were sent to Iras. But he later admitted that he was the sole perpetrator who inflated his business expenses in order to evade additional income tax totalling $51,173.85. In actual fact, after expenses, Lam had an income of $70,172 in 2013 and $401,356 in 2014. Lam has since made partial restitution of $38,113.96 of the outstanding tax owed. In its sentencing submissions, Iras Senior Tax Prosecutor Norman Teo said there was a significant degree of planning and premeditation on Lam's part. The prosecution also submitted a new sentencing framework that led to a stiffer jail term for such offences, which would have previously resulted in a jail term of between one and two weeks. "

Nurul, enraged by her words, followed her and punched her a few times in the face, causing  her lip to bleed. After that, Nurul went to the kitchen and took a chopper with a 17cm-long blade. She used it to slash her mother-in-law.  ""The victim tried to take the chopper away from the accused while the accused continued to slash at her. The victim managed to grab hold of the chopper eventually and tossed it aside,"" said DPP Ng. Madam Fatimah ran out of the flat and Mr Ahmad followed her before he alerted the police. She was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital where she was warded until Dec 18 last year. She did not suffer any permanent injuries, the court heard. Defence lawyer Aw Sze Min, who was assigned to the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, pleaded for Nurul to be jailed for six months, stressing that she has been accepted back into the family. For assaulting Madam Fatimah with the chopper, she could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined. "

""Let me be quite clear, it's not possible for us to do so, regardless of how many requests we receive,"" said Mr Shanmugam. He added that the Singapore Government will not intervene when there are no legal reasons to do so and when the courts have already imposed a sentence. ""It is not tenable to give a special moratorium to Malaysians, and impose it on everyone else, including Singaporeans who commit offences which carry  He added that the death penalty is imposed because evidence shows that it is an effective deterrent. ""And we are not going to be deflected from doing the right thing for Singapore,"" he said. Mr Shanmugam revealed that his Malaysian counterpart, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Liew Vui Keong, who is the de-facto Law Minister, had spoken to Senior Minister of State for Law Edwin Tong and written to the Singapore Government over the case of Pannir Selvam Pranthaman. The 31-year-old Malaysian drug mule is on death row here and got a temporary reprieve  ""We will respond to Mr Liew once the case is over,"" said Mr Shanmugam. Speaking at the Central Narcotics Bureau's workplan seminar at the Home Team Academy, Mr Shanmugam said some ministers in the Pakatan Harapan government are ""ideologically opposed"" to the death penalty. ""And we have to respect that,"" he said. ""At the same time, we do impose a death penalty in Singapore, and I expect that Malaysia will respect that condition as well."" He added that Singapore's population is supportive of that stand, and the death penalty is imposed because it is an ""effective deterrent"" against drug offences. Mr Shanmugam revealed that last year, almost 30 per cent of drug traffickers caught here were Malaysians, and nearly 30 per cent of the heroin seized here, by weight, was brought in by Malaysians. He added that one in five traffickers who brought in drugs above the threshold that brings the death penalty was also a Malaysian. ""How do we go easy on Malaysians in the face of these statistics? And if we did, what will it mean for the rule of law? It will become a joke if there is a request made and we go easy. That is not the way Singapore works,"" said Mr Shanmugam. He said that when he responds to Datuk Liew, he will make three key suggestions to get to the root of the problem. First, he will request for statistics on how many drug traffickers the Malaysian authorities pick up on their side of the border. ""I assume their border control is as good, (that) they have strict laws on drugs. I assume they have as much of a will and intention to enforce them as we do,"" said Mr Shanmugam. ""If they can make sure they arrest the traffickers before they come into Singapore, that helps them and it helps us. The traffickers do not have to face the death penalty – they can keep them in Malaysia."" He will secondly ask about efforts to catch drug kingpins who operate in Malaysia and are ""too scared to come into Singapore"". ""We have good cooperation with Malaysian agencies; they do a good job, we cooperate effectively. And I hope they can be given every support, and we can get more evidence on the other kingpins operating in Malaysia to be picked up,"" said Mr Shanmugam. Third, he said it would be helpful if the penalties that Singapore imposes on drug traffickers are widely publicised among the potential drug-trafficking group. He identified the group to be predominantly poor, less educated and Indian, who traffic drugs to earn ""a few hundred ringgit"". Mr Shanmugam said that the drug trafficking situation, if dealt with, would benefit both countries, adding that a practical way is to address the social situation of the vulnerable in Malaysia. ""If we worry about lives - both governments, and we do - then I would suggest that these are concrete, practical steps that can be taken,"" he said. ""It is simply not doable to keep asking Singapore not to carry out the penalties imposed by the courts,"" said Mr Shanmugam, who later elaborated on the serious drug problem in the region. Pannir Selvam, represented by Singapore lawyers Too Xing Ji and Lee Ji En, had applied for his death sentence to be stayed on the basis that he intends to mount a legal challenge against the rejection of his petition for clemency to President Halimah Yacob. A three-judge Court of Appeal that granted his request had noted that Pannir Selvam was told of the rejection and his execution date just one week in advance. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said this did not leave the prisoner much time to obtain legal advice on what options he has to challenge the rejection of his clemency plea. Mr Too had raised questions during the hearing about the ""lack of transparency"" of the clemency process in relation to Pannir Selvam, who was convicted of importing 51.84g of heroin in 2017. In a statement on Thursday night addressing Malaysian media reports about the case, the Ministry of Home Affairs said the petitions were carefully considered. It added that the President acted on the advice of the Cabinet, in accordance with the Constitution, in not exercising the clemency power. "

Vietnamese national Nguyen Thi Thu Lan faced one count of cheating one of the victims of $666,048 by deceiving the man into believing that she was selling him 12kg of gold bars, according to court documents. In a statement on Friday, the police said that several victims reported in January and February that they were approached by Lan, who claimed to operate a gold brokerage firm. She claimed that the company was selling gold at a discounted price. The victims were directed to make bank transfers of between $261,000 and $3.54 million, purportedly for buying gold. However, Lan allegedly did not fulfil the purchase orders after the payments were made. Officers from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division identified Lan through follow-up investigations and arrested her on Wednesday. Preliminary investigations show that she was believed to be involved in at least five gold investment scam cases, where victims were cheated of more than $5.4 million, police said. They added that a 24-year-old man is assisting in investigations into the case. Lan is due to appear in court again on May 31. If convicted of cheating, she may be jailed up to 10 years or fined. "

Wang Jianliang - an associate professor at Nanyang Technological University (NTU ) - was branded ""belligerent"" by a judge, who heard how the 57-year-old had braked abruptly three times in front of a car that had not given way to him. The professor then got out of his vehicle on the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) to argue with the other driver,  District Judge Christopher Tan jailed Wang for a week, fined him $2,000 and banned him from driving for six months on Thursday (May 23). He said when Wang was out of the car, he was ""as belligerent as he was behind the wheel"".  He added: ""I am left with no doubt that this is a road rage case."" Wang, who works at NTU's School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, had pleaded guilty to committing a rash act and an act of mischief. Another charge of using criminal force was taken into consideration during sentencing. Wang and the other driver - 60-year-old Samuel Lim - were driving near Pioneer Road North during the evening rush hour on March 16, 2017, when they joined a lane that merged onto a packed PIE. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sheryl Yeo said Mr Lim refused to give way to Wang, which ""greatly annoyed"" him . ""He intentionally sped up and drove on the road shoulder in order to overtake the victim's car,"" she added. When Wang was directly in front of Mr Lim's car, he abruptly jammed on the brakes twice to show his displeasure towards him. When he did so a third time, Mr Lim failed to brake in time and collided into Wang's rear bumper. Both men got out of their cars to take photos of the scene and when Mr Lim refused to hand over his driving licence to Wang, Wang flew into a rage and yelled at him, the court heard. When Mr Lim attempted to return to his car, Wang forcefully opened Mr Lim's car door and grabbed his arm. Wang then hit Mr Lim's car window and bonnet. The damage to Mr Lim's car bonnet, bumper and number plate added up to more than $4,000. Wang later offered to pay for the damage, but Mr Lim declined. Defence counsel Eugene Thuraisingam asked for Wang to be fined instead, citing factors such as the lack of injuries and premeditation, and the offer of compensation. Wang is out on bail as he intends to appeal against his sentence. He has been suspended by NTU pending disciplinary proceedings. The university said: ""NTU expects all members of its community to represent the highest ethical standards and to comply with the law at all times."" For committing an act so rashly as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, Wang could have been jailed for up to six months and fined $2,500. "

Pannir Selvam Pranthaman, 31, applied for his death sentence to be stayed on the basis that he intends to mount a legal challenge against the rejection of his petition for clemency to President Halimah Yacob. On Thursday (May 23), a three-judge Court of Appeal granted his request, noting that Pannir Selvam was told of the rejection and his execution date just one week in advance. This did not leave the prisoner much time to obtain legal advice on what options he has to challenge the rejection of his clemency plea, said Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. He added that Pannir Selvam's Singapore lawyers, Mr Too Xing Ji and Mr Lee Ji En, who were instructed only on Thursday, could not be expected to mount a fully developed argument in such a time frame. CJ Menon said: ""There are extremely narrow grounds upon which the clemency process may be so impugned. However, in our judgment, the applicant ought to have a reasonable opportunity to take advice on whether he can mount a successful challenge."" During the hearing, Mr Too raised questions about the ""lack of transparency"" of the clemency process in relation to Pannir Selvam, who was convicted of importing 51.84g of heroin in 2017. The court heard that two letters sent to his family - one from the Istana rejecting the clemency petition and the other from the Singapore Prison Service stating his execution date - were both dated May 17. In an affidavit, Pannir Selvam said his family had courier receipts to show that the letters were posted out on May 16. He took issue with the sequence of events, arguing that he had been deprived of a fair clemency process. In response, the prosecution, represented by Senior Counsel Francis Ng, submitted affidavits from the Istana, the Attorney-General's Chambers and the prisons, to set out the sequence of events. Mr Benny Lee, principal private secretary to the President, said in his affidavit that prior to May 7, Madam Halimah had been advised by the Cabinet that the law should be allowed to take its course in Pannir Selvam's case. On May 7, Mr Lee signed letters informing Pannir Selvam and his family that the death sentence would stand. These letters were sent to the prisons on May 14, to be forwarded to the prisoner and his family. In a statement addressing Malaysian media reports about the case, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the petitions were carefully considered. The President acted on the advice of the Cabinet, in accordance with the Constitution, in not exercising the clemency power, said the statement on Thursday. The ministry also clarified reports claiming that Pannir Selvam was unreasonably denied a certificate of substantive assistance, which might have spared him the mandatory death penalty. ""MHA would like to clarify that the decision is taken by the Public Prosecutor in his sole discretion, based on whether the offender had provided the authorities substantive assistance that leads to the disruption of drug trafficking activities in Singapore. The Public Prosecutor determined that he had not,"" it added. This issue was not pursued in court by Mr Too, who focused on the clemency process. He argued that it was still not clear when the decision was made, why the letters were post-dated, and why the decision had not been communicated earlier to his client's family. He said his client was deprived of the time to consult a lawyer to see if there were any grounds to file a judicial review against the rejection of his clemency petition. The court, which also comprised Judges of Appeal Judith Prakash and Steven Chong, directed Pannir Selvam to file his intended application and supporting evidence in two weeks. The prosecution will have two weeks to respond, then both sides have another week to file written submissions, before a hearing date is fixed. Challenges against the clemency process are rare.

The DPP said: ""After some time, when the victim was unable to endure it any longer, the victim sat up with her back facing the accused and pretended she had just been woken up by some movements and did not know what had happened.

However, she was afraid to confront her father and did not tell her mother about her ordeal, for fear of being disbelieved. The teenager found it difficult to concentrate in school, and a teacher who noticed a change in her behaviour referred her to a counsellor. An officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development then took her to the police to file a report. Defence lawyer Ashwin Ganapathy said in his mitigation plea that his client had difficulties controlling his sexual urges as he was addicted to pornography. Anyone found guilty of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. The man cannot be caned as he is above 50. "

For ordering the attack, Lim Hong Liang, 55, was yesterday sentenced to six years' jail. Following a 10-day trial, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt convicted him on April 2 of taking part in a seven-person conspiracy to cause grievous hurt to banquet waiter Joshua Koh Kian Yong, 35. The judge also found a middleman linked to the attack - mover Ong Hock Chye, 48 - guilty of a similar offence. He was sentenced to 51/2 years' jail and six strokes of the cane. Lim, a married man with three children, was smitten with Ms Audrey Chen Ying Fang, 27, after they met in 2014. She won the Miss Mermaid beauty pageant two years later. He gave her a job at SNL Logistics, the Singapore-based firm he owns, as an administrative executive, for which she was paid about $2,000 a month. However, the court heard that she did not have to turn up for work. Lim lavished gifts on her. A Mercedes-Benz he gave her carried the plate ""1991"", her birth year. She also used his credit cards to pay for her needs. He also allowed her to live rent-free in a unit he owned at The Parc condominium in West Coast Walk, renovating it to her preferred Hello Kitty theme. In their submissions, deputy public prosecutors Tan Wen Hsien and Stephanie Koh said: ""In return, Lim expected her to be faithful to him, and not to 'fool around outside'."" But in March 2016, Ms Chen started dating Mr Koh and announced their relationship on social media, and Lim found out. On April 8, Lim's older son, whose name was not stated in court papers, and his nephew Ron Lim De Mai, 26, turned up at the condo. Ron Lim rained blows on Mr Koh, fracturing his nose. According to court documents, Lim wanted his nephew to ""teach Joshua a lesson"" and it was Ron Lim who later roped in Ong to recruit others to carry out the task. Lim paid $5,000 to the hitmen to scar Mr Koh. On April 30, 2016, Ms Chen and Mr Koh were having supper at Huay Kwang Thai Kitchen in Townshend Road near Little India when he was ambushed by a group of men. He was punched in the head, and as he tried to run, was slashed with a penknife on his arm and face. The slasher - Nur Muhammad Irwan Mohd Ngat, 30 - and the others involved in the attack have been dealt with in court. Yesterday, the court heard that Lim and Ong intend to appeal against Judge Chay's decisions. Lim was offered bail of $10,000 while Ong's bail was set at $30,000. "

Mondol Faruk, a former work permit holder, faced one count of harbouring a male Sri Lankan immigration offender. A second charge of harbouring another Sri Lankan man illegally was taken into consideration during sentencing. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), in a statement on Tuesday, said Faruk, who was an occupant of a unit in Cuff Road, was tasked by the main tenants to take care of the unit and collect rental from the other occupants. He was, however, not authorised to allow anyone else to stay in the unit. Despite this, Faruk sublet the unit to two 22-year-old Sri Lankan men, Savarimuthu Kanistan and Agalepola Shaween Ashinshana. Both Sri Lankan nationals did not offer to show any identification documents to Faruk. He also did not ask them for any documents to verify if their stay in Singapore was valid. On March 13, ICA officers conducted a check on the unit and arrested Kanistan and Ashinshana. Kanistan had remained unlawfully in Singapore for 33 days after his visit pass had expired, while Ashinshana was in Singapore unlawfully for six days. ICA said Faruk had not exercised due diligence by carrying out at least two out of three checks required under the law, before allowing the two Sri Lankans to stay in the rented unit. Kanistan and Ashinshana were both sentenced on March 14 for their overstaying offences. Kanistan was jailed for three weeks for not being able to pay a fine of $2,500, while Ashinshana was jailed for two days as he could not pay his $500 fine. ICA said the main tenants were given verbal advisories, as the authority found that the unit was sublet by Faruk without their knowledge. In its statement, ICA said it takes a firm stance against those who harbour immigration offenders. Those who wish to rent their premises must exercise due diligence in checking the status of their prospective foreign tenants to ensure that their status in Singapore is legal, it added. The three mandatory checks are: - Check the tenant's original immigration or work pass; - Cross check the particulars on his or her pass against the particulars on his or her original passport; and - Verify the validity of his or her pass by checking with the issuing authority, such as the Manpower Ministry or ICA. Anyone found guilty of recklessly or knowingly harbouring overstayers and/or illegal immigrants may face up to two years' jail and be fined up to $6,000. Those convicted of negligently harbouring overstayers and/or illegal immigrants may be jailed up to 12 months, fined up to $6,000, or both. "

It was only when her teacher referred her to a school counsellor that her ordeal came to light, and the 52-year-old father was arrested. On Tuesday (May 21) the man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his daughter's identity, was jailed for 16 months after pleading guilty to one count of outraging his daughter's modesty. A second charge for molestation involving the same girl was considered during sentencing. The girl lived with her parents in a flat in north-eastern Singapore, where she shared a queen-sized bed with her father. He first molested the teenager in January last year, when he groped her chest. Two months later, he touched her private parts while she was half-asleep.

Offenders included those who drove with a revoked or invalid licence, or without a prior licence. Singapore Road Safety Council chairman Bernard Tay said there may be more offenders now because of a perception that they are unlikely to be caught. It could also be that more people are private-hire or commercial drivers. He is supportive of heavier penalties that were proposed under a new Bill tabled in Parliament earlier this month. Under this Bill, those who drive without a licence could face stiffer penalties soon. First-time offenders could face three years' jail or a fine of up to $10,000. A second offence could draw up to six years' jail or a fine of up to $20,000. Current penalties are three months' jail or up to $1,000 fine for the first offence, and for the second offence, six months' jail or up to $2,000 in fines. Proposed amendments to the Road Traffic Act include heavier penalties for those who drive under disqualification or suspension.

However, none was banned from driving for life despite their repeated defiance of the law. Under proposed changes to the Road Traffic Act, such individuals could face a lifetime ban from driving and double the current jail time if they are caught drink-driving for the third time or more. Road safety experts that spoke to The Straits Times noted that while the number of such recalcitrant offenders appears small, drink-driving remains a problem. Last year, there was a 17.3 per cent spike in drink-driving accidents to 176 cases from 150 in 2017, Traffic Police figures released earlier this year showed. ""Many will welcome the lifetime ban from driving for recalcitrant offenders,"" said transport analyst Gopinath Menon, who is a senior research fellow at Nanyang Technological University. Other proposed changes include minimum mandatory sentences for dangerous driving causing death and grievous hurt, as well as additional penalties for offenders who did so while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Under current penalties for drink-driving offences, those convicted face up to six months in jail or can be fined between $1,000 and $5,000 for the first offence. For the second offence, they can be jailed for a maximum of one year and fined between $3,000 and $10,000. They will also face disqualification from driving for at least a year. Proposed amendments to the Act double these penalties. If the changes come to pass, first-time offenders will face up to a year in jail, or be fined $2,000 to $10,000, and be disqualified from driving for at least two years. For the second offence, they will face up to two years in jail and be fined between $5,000 and $20,000, as well as face a ban from driving for at least five years. For subsequent offences, they will be banned from driving for life. Another notable proposed change is an immediate suspension for motorists caught for drink-driving, to prevent them from driving irresponsibly before the courts have decided on their cases. Drivers whom ST spoke to welcomed the proposed enhanced penalties. Mr Aloysious Fong, 61, who has been driving for 40 years, said the changes are ""long overdue"". ""It's about time that the authorities reviewed the Road Traffic Act. The stiffer penalties will really wake people up, especially the doubled jail terms,"" he added. "

Investigations into all of the suspects are being conducted, CNB said. Among the drugs seized was 580g of Ice, enough to feed the addiction of roughly 331 abusers for a week. In one operation, CNB received information on a drug transaction that was about to happen at Tanjong Pagar. Officers deployed there spotted two suspected drug traffickers who briefly met and departed separately. The first suspect, 44, left in a taxi and was arrested when it stopped in Victoria Street. An improvised drug-smoking apparatus and 32g of Ice was found on him. The other suspect, 38, returned to his residence near Tanjong Pagar. He was arrested there by a CNB team which also raided the place and recovered 7g of Ice and some drug-taking utensils. He was then taken to the lift lobby on the 16th floor of the building, where about 5g of cannabis and four fragmented Ecstasy tablets were found hidden in the dry riser.

A distressed property is usually the result of a home owner who is unable to keep up with its mortgage. Such properties are commonly sold below the market value. The court heard that Leong, 55, also told her victims that she would use their investments to fund start-ups and reap ""lucrative monthly returns"". However, she did not use her victims' funds for their intended purposes. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Chin said: ""In reality, Leong would use the monies collected from more recent victims to pay off her earlier victims, while enjoying her criminal proceeds in the meantime."" She was sentenced on Friday (May 17) to 14 years' jail after pleading guilty to 50 cheating charges and one count of dealing with the benefits of her criminal activities. Another 806 charges were considered during sentencing. The Straits Times understands that Leong used to be a real estate agent, but she was no longer one when she committed the offences. From January 2010 and May 2015, she told her victims  She also told her victims that she had been dealing with investments involving such properties for many years and claimed she had ""insider knowledge"" due to her purported connections with a banker and a lawyer. DPP Chin said: ""The accused told the victims that their funds would be used to purchase such properties. In addition, the accused told the victims that she would resell these properties to her ready pool of foreign buyers, who were keen to invest in Singapore properties, at higher prices. The difference between the prices would therefore constitute the profits earned by the victims."" In 2014, she ran another ruse in which some of her victims were told that she was funding start-ups. She then invited them to invest money with her, promising monthly returns of 7 per cent to 9 per cent. In her ponzi scheme, she encouraged her victims to increase their investments with her. She also encouraged them to refer others to her purported money-making ventures. The DPP added: ""Hence, some investors introduced their relatives and friends to participate in the accused's Ponzi scheme. The accused also convinced some victims to pawn their gold items or withdraw their CPF funds in order to invest with her."" The amount cheated in Leong's case is unprecedented, said the DPP. In 2015, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received police reports lodged by complainants against Leong. But she left for Thailand on May 15 that year, before the CAD started its investigation into her case. The court heard she later ran out of money and surrendered herself at the Singapore embassy in Bangkok on Nov 2, 2017. She was arrested when she returned to Singapore two days later. Leong has been an undischarged bankrupt since April 21, 2016 and many of the victims were her close friends. DPP Ling said that she had used her ill-gotten gains money for her own expenses such as mortgage loan repayments and family expenses.  Her offences came to light when she began delaying payments by late 2014. She told the victims that she would refund all outstanding payments by May 18, 2015. Leong could not fully repay them and decided to leave Singapore. On Friday, DPP Chin urged District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim to sentence Leong to at least 14 to 15 years' jail, stressing that she had made no restitution. Defence lawyer Tito Issac, however, pleaded for his client to be given between eight and nine years' jail. He also told the judge that Leong was ""immensely remorseful"". For each count of cheating, she could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. "

Yesterday, a Singapore district court heard that between Oct 2 and 16 that year, Citibank received 24 payment instructions purportedly sent by NBE. The lender later transferred the money to various accounts in countries such as Australia, Japan and China. One of the accounts was provided by the Nigerian director of a Singapore-based wholesale company. Paul Gabriel Amos had received a call from a friend asking him for an account to transfer ill-gotten gains into.

Acting on Amos' instructions later that month, Mohammad Sohail transferred about US$670,000 from Mac-Warners' bank account to Ideal Con's.

In May 2017, Foo downloaded the Onion Router browser to surf the Internet anonymously, and used it to access websites on the Dark Web - a part of the Internet that is not open to public view and is known for its trade in illegal goods such as drugs.

At least 14 such scams have been reported since January this year, with victims being cheated of at least $14,000. Scammers would pretend to be friends or followers of the victims on Instagram, and would message victims claiming they would help them sign up for a Lazada campaign to win money. However, the campaigns - which scammers often named Lazada Campaign, Lazada Raffle, Lazada Gift Money and Lazada Lucky Draw - were actually fakes. The scammers would ask victims for their contact numbers and photos of their credit or debit cards, as well as the one-time passwords of their bank accounts. The victims eventually realised they had been cheated after discovering unauthorised card transactions on their accounts. A Lazada spokesman said yesterday that customer safety is the company's top priority, and emphasised that the company is in no way associated with the scams.

The 29-year-old Indonesian was sentenced to 14 days' jail on Wednesday (May 15) after admitting that she had given false information to a police officer attached to the Serious Sexual Crime Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gregory Gan said that the man's wife alerted the police on Feb 7, stating that Sumaini had been ""sexually abused"".

The DPP said that after recording Sumaini's statement, the policeman checked her mobile phone and discovered text messages exchanged on Facebook Messenger between the maid and her employer's husband. These messages included one from Sumaini stating that she missed the man, and suggested that they were in a relationship. The policeman confronted Sumaini with the messages and she finally came clean at around 10pm. The man was released about an hour later.

At least 14 such scams have been reported since January this year, with victims being cheated of at least $14,000. Scammers would pretend to be friends or followers of the victims on Instagram, and would message victims claiming they would help them sign up for a Lazada campaign to win money. However, the campaigns, which scammers often named ""Lazada Campaign"", ""Lazada Raffle"", ""Lazada Gift Money"" and ""Lazada Lucky Draw"", were actually fakes. The scammers would ask victims for their contact numbers and photos of their credit or debit cards, as well as the one-time passwords of their bank accounts. The victims eventually realised they had been cheated after discovering unauthorised card transactions on their accounts. A Lazada spokesman said on Wednesday that customer safety is the company's top priority, and emphasised that Lazada is in no way associated with the scams. All of Lazada's campaigns and contests are held only on its website, app, and official social media accounts, he added.  He said: ""We would like to remind customers to only conduct transactions on our platforms; never via third-party channels.""

They should beware of unusual requests from strangers, as well as from contacts on social media, the warning said. Members of the public should always verify such requests by contacting their friends using a method other than the social media platform they received the request on, as their friend's account may have been taken over by scammers. Finally, individuals should not transfer money or give out personal information or credit and debit card and bank account details to strangers.

Yesterday, the man, now 51, was sentenced to 29 years' jail after he pleaded guilty to two charges of statutory rape and one charge of aggravated sexual assault by penetration. Six other sexual offence charges were considered during sentencing by Judicial Commissioner Audrey Lim, who said the man's actions were ""clearly and totally reprehensible"".
