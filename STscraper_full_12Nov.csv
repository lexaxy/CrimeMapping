Among other denials, the 54-year-old Isa Ahmad now claims he did not rob a second female victim of her mobile phone. As a result of Isa disputing the details, Second Principal District Judge Victor Yeo rejected his earlier guilty plea and set aside his conviction. After the Singaporean pleaded guilty on Oct 23 to one count each of robbery and attempted aggravated rape, the court heard his past convictions, which involved multiple counts of robbery. For the offences, he was sentenced to eight years' corrective training and 12 strokes of the cane in June 1994. Corrective training is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour. The maximum period is 14 years. After his release, Isa again committed robbery and was last sentenced in October 2002 to 14 years of preventive detention with the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. This prison regime is only for repeat offenders who are above 30 years old. He was finally released in 2016 but on March 12, 2017, allegedly targeted the two women. According to court documents, he tried to rape the tourist that day and later, robbed a 48-year-old woman at the nearby Tang Plaza of her mobile phone. His pre-trial conference will take place on Nov 19. Offenders convicted of attempted aggravated rape can be jailed for up to 10 years and caned. Isa cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old. "

Former Aetos Security Management employee Chai Chong Sien pilfered the monies on multiple occasions between March and June this year, while his colleagues were busy replenishing the cash in the ATMs. On Tuesday (Nov 12), the 34-year-old was sentenced to nine months' jail after he pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust. Chai was part of a three-man team charged with topping up the cash in ATMs belonging to DBS bank, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Thiam Jia Min told the court. He was commonly deployed as a driver in the team, and his two teammates were responsible for transporting cash cassettes to the ATMs. As the designated replenishment officer and guardsman, Chai's teammates were required to don body-worn cameras to ensure they did not steal cash while handling the cassettes. But Chai, as the driver, did not have to as he was not supposed to be handling the cash cassettes. According to Aetos' standard operating procedure, the designated replenishment officer has to call the command centre for a code to open the van's vault in which the cash cassettes are stored, said DPP Thiam. ""As this process was troublesome and time-consuming, a common practice on the ground was for the RO (replenishment officer) to pre-load multiple cash cassettes out of the vault onto the passenger seats of the van,"" she said. This meant that Chai, as the driver, was often left alone to ""safeguard"" the van and preloaded cash cassettes, while the other two were replenishing cash, she said. ""The accused would use some force to knock on the cassette shutter, which would then open and allow him access to the cash contained inside,"" said DPP Thiam. Chai's actions only came to light when DBS found a significant shortfall of cash in its ATMs, which ""prompted an internal investigation by Aetos"", she said. Chai spent $2,900 of the stolen monies to cover personal expenses. The police seized the remaining $20,100, which had been hidden under Chai's bed in his rented home. No restitution has been made for the sum spent. A spokesman for Aetos said Chai is no longer with the company, adding that Aetos has zero tolerance towards such acts of misconduct. ""We will also continue to strengthen all processes to ensure full compliance and security of the utmost standards,"" said the spokesman. For his crime, Chai could have been jailed up to 15 years and fined. "

The 1.05m tall boy – who cannot be named due to a gag order – was squeezed into the cage which measured 91cm long, 58cm wide and 70cm tall. He was also pinched with pliers on his thighs and buttocks, hit with various objects - including a broom and hanger - and was scalded with hot water. These acts of physical and psychological abuse were allegedly inflicted by his own parents, from July 2016 until his death on Oct 23 that year. When the boy finally collapsed from his injuries that included severe burns across 70 per cent of his body, the couple allegedly delayed sending him to the hospital for six hours. Azlin Arujunah and Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman, both 27, did this out of fear that they would get into trouble for child abuse. Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Wen Hsien, Daphne Lim and Li Yihong said the couple blatantly disregarded the boy's welfare and his life. ""This is a murder as horrific as it is tragic,"" said the prosecution team in their opening statement on Tuesday (Nov 12) in the High Court, on the first day of the trial. ""Leaving aside the physical abuse he suffered, one cannot imagine the pain and torment the deceased must have endured in the months leading up to his death. He was tortured to his death, and had no one to turn to,"" they added. The married couple each  They are also facing charges relating to the ill-treatment of the child and voluntarily causing hurt by means of a heated substance. The court heard that the boy was fostered out shortly after his birth and lived with his foster family from around March 2011 until May 2015, when he was returned to the couple. From June 2016, he suffered abuse allegedly at the hands of his parents while living with them and his siblings in a one-room flat in Toa Payoh. In August that year, the boy developed a limp as a result of a misaligned kneecap he sustained after his mother Azlin allegedly hit him repeatedly with a broom over biscuits she found scattered on the kitchen floor. In the week leading up to his death - between Oct 15 and 22 that year - the boy was scalded with multiple cups of hot water on at least four occasions, causing him to suffer from severe scald injury that led to his eventual death. The day before he died, the boy was hit on his head, hands and legs allegedly by Ridzuan, the father, using a broom, because he had refused to take off his shorts to grab a shower. Ridzuan then allegedly threw several cups of hot water at his son's legs and body, causing the child to shout ""don't want, don't want"" in Malay. The prosecution team said the boy crouched over as Ridzuan poured hot water over his son's back and calf area, and the child fell forward onto the bathroom floor and stopped moving. Upon his admission to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, the boy was found to be in a critical condition with symptoms such as low body temperature and low blood pressure. He also had second- to third-degree burns across up to 70 per cent of the body, dehydration, acute kidney injury, multiple facial wounds and a broken nose, and demonstrated isolated speech delay. Associate Professor Loh Tsee Foong, a senior consultant of the hospital's Children's Intensive Care Unit, testified in court on Tuesday that the boy also had severe anaemia that was ""almost life threatening"", suggesting significant blood loss over a period of time. Prof Loh added that while he was told that the child had been playing with a kettle when it fell over him, he found the injuries to be ""very suspicious"" and did not appear to be accidental. Despite the hospital's efforts to resuscitate him, the boy died about 14 hours later. ""The child passed away very quickly, and the nurses were very distressed. The hospital had to counsel and give some support to the nurses because they became very emotional, they couldn't believe that this could happen to a child,"" he said. ""The child would have suffered from an extreme amount of pain. It's quite unimaginable."" Ridzuan was arrested on Oct 23, while Azlin was arrested on Oct 25. Psychiatric assessments of the couple by the Institute of Mental Health during their remand found that Azlin had been suffering from an adjustment disorder in the period leading up to the offences. She was also found to have an abnormal personality characterised by dependent and anti-social traits. Meanwhile, Ridzuan appeared to have anti-social personality traits, but did not suffer from any mental disorder or intellectual disability. The couple were also assessed to be not of unsound mind at the time of the offences. The trial continues. "

It later resurfaced in October. The police said on Tuesday that it received a report last Thursday in relation to the fake website. A 52-year-old woman told the police that $3,300 had been transferred from her bank account without her consent. She had received a call from someone claiming to be from the SPF who alleged she was involved in illegal activities. The call was then transferred to someone claiming to be a law enforcement officer in China, who then directed her to a website resembling the SPF website. The victim was then instructed to key in her bank account details, password and one-time password. The woman suspected that she was scammed after receiving a text message alerting her that money had been transferred from her account into an overseas account. The police are investigating the case. They said that victims of this scam typically receive calls from scammers, claiming that the victims are the holders of bank accounts with large amounts of money. The scammers also claim that the victims are suspected of being involved in criminal activities such as money laundering.

He faces four charges in all and allegedly committed these offences at the Ocean Financial Centre in Collyer Quay in April and October 2017. He cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the woman's identity. On the second day of the trial on Tuesday (Nov 12), the court heard that the lawyer, who is now working for another firm, gave a statement in November 2017 to investigation officer (IO) Thanabalan Kothandapani in which he admitted his alleged offences. This incriminating statement could potentially be submitted to the court as evidence against him. He is now contesting its admissibility, stating that the IO had offered to close the case if he agreed to conditions including admitting the offences and apologising to the parties involved. When queried by District Judge Samuel Chua on Tuesday, the man said: ""First, there was a guarantee that by doing so, there would be no court proceedings. ""Second, to my mind, there was something like a settlement negotiation. People do apologise and admit to things which they didn't do in order to procure an amicable closure to matters."" The judge also asked the lawyer why he saw the need to give an apology to exculpate himself. He replied: ""(It's because) of the offer that the IO had given me - that the matter would not go to the AGC (Attorney-General's Chambers) if I did all these things. ""I simply wanted the matter to be closed so I could live my life."" He also said he wanted to avoid the ""whole process"" of going on trial, adding that if he faced charges, ""the matter would have appeared in major news outlets"", which would have affected his mother's health. The man, who is represented by defence lawyer Tan Hee Joek, did not give the details about his mother's condition on Tuesday in court. According to court documents, he allegedly pressed his thigh against his then colleague's upper arm and used his mobile phone to snap pictures of the woman's underwear on Oct 11, 2017. He is also accused of snapping pictures of her chest and undergarments on two occasions in April that year.  The man is now out on bail of $15,000 and his pre-trial conference will be held on Nov 26. In a statement, Drew & Napier said that it has a “strict zero-tolerance policy” towards misconduct of any nature.  Its spokesman  said: “Our colleagues work hard to maintain a supportive and respectful work environment with an open-door policy. We are fully committed to ensuring that every single member of our firm feels safe, and that reported cases of misconduct, sexual or otherwise, are responded to swiftly.  “Appropriate steps were taken when the allegations came to light. As the matter is before the courts, we cannot comment further at this time.” If convicted of insulting the woman's modesty, the man can be jailed for up to a year and fined for each charge. Offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. "

The High Court awarded the sum to Smile Inc Dental Surgeons in judgment grounds yesterday, after assessing the damages payable by OP3 International for breaches that led the clinic to close for three extended periods, between 2013 and 2015. Smile had sued OP3 for alleged defective design and construction of the clinic and in 2017, it was found liable for the three periods totalling 321 days. The judge in yesterday's decision grounds assessed the amount OP3 had to pay after a five-day hearing that stretched over several months. The periods of closure comprised 50 days in 2013 for delayed completion of fitting works, 51 days in 2014 and another 220 days in 2015 after two floods in 2014 caused by OP3's failure ""to ensure the works were designed and executed in a manner that was fit for its intended purpose"", the judge said. As a result of the second flood, Smile found mould had grown again on the same walls of the filing room in the clinic on July 21, 2014. On July 29, 2014, Smile closed the clinic, which was repossessed by the landlord in March 2015. Justice Chan Seng Onn said Smile's claims were ""aplenty, ranging from its expenses flowing from the removal and storage of equipment and items in the Suntec clinic, to expenses it had incurred to remedy the impact of the floods"". He noted Smile also claimed for loss of profits suffered during the three ""blackout periods"", among other things, and the total sum sought was more than $1,312,407.87. In an 84-page judgment, the judge dealt with each item claimed grouped into four categories and assessed sums for each of them. These included $80,573 for flood investigation and remediation costs, and $151,384 for wasted depreciation expenses from March 2015 till the end of the lease in September 2016. <strong>$1.3m</strong> Total sum Smile Inc Dental Surgeons was claiming in its lawsuit against OP3 International. The court rejected Smile's claim for $265,399.38 for ""loss of management time and expense"" allegedly suffered due to the first and second floods. But it awarded the biggest single item, loss of patient revenue, as a result of the blackout periods. The judge estimated the average patient revenue per day for the Suntec clinic was $2,076.91 per operational day based on the $454,843.44 revenue earned for the 219 days it operated. Hence, the total patient revenue deemed lost for 321 blackout days came to $666,688. From this sum, the judge deducted $400,013 for variable expenses based on an average ratio of expense to revenue for an indicated period and found the sum payable for patient revenue loss to be $266,675. But lawyers Vijai Parwani and Nicholas Chandra argued that Smile suffered no patient revenue loss during the blackout periods as they were diverted to Smile's other dental clinics. Smile, represented by lawyers Ho Chien Mien and Samantha Teong, countered, among other things, that the patients were not automatically diverted to Smile's other clinics when the Suntec outlet was closed. Justice Chan accepted there was at least some diversion to Smile's other clinics but the actual proportion ""is an entirely different question"". The judge rejected the argument that there was no loss suffered by Smile during the repeated closures, noting that the diversion effect would be cancelled out by the ""opposing disruption effect"" on the clinic caused by the repeated and intermittent closures. Justice Chan allowed $87,432 to OP3 in its counterclaim for the unpaid balance of renovation work done to be deducted from the amount payable to Smile. The total sum eventually due to Smile would be $534,189. "

A second similar charge will be considered during sentencing. He cannot be named as a gag order has been imposed to protect the girl's identity. Deputy Public Prosecutor Derek Ee said the girl had referred to the man as ""uncle"". It was not stated if he is still married to her mother. The DPP told District Judge Teo Guan Kee: ""The accused stated that he initially treated the victim as his stepdaughter. However, as time went by, they gradually became closer and often texted each other. This eventually led to the accused having sex with the victim.""

They also saw him, and quickly dressed themselves. The man initially denied having sex in the car when questioned, the court heard. He was offered bail of $15,000 yesterday.

Tay Boon Keh was yesterday sentenced to 20 days in jail for mischief. Under the Penal Code, it is an offence to cause wrongful loss or damage to another person's property. In what is believed to be the first case of its kind, the 66-year-old had pleaded guilty in October last year to 20 counts of mischief. Another 266 similar charges were considered during sentencing. As a result of Tay swopping the tags on 286 pieces of luggage, the two carriers had to pay compensation totalling more than $42,000 to 221 affected passengers. At the time of the offences - between November 2016 and February 2017 - Tay was employed by industrial equipment supplier Lian Cheng Contracting, a subcontractor of the Changi Airport Group. He is no longer working at the airport. The court heard that he was suffering from major depressive disorder during that period. A hearing was held to determine if there was a causal link between the offences and his condition. Yesterday, District Judge Jasvender Kaur said she found that his major depressive disorder ""had not caused or significantly contributed to the offending"". She added that she accepted evidence from the prosecution's psychiatrist Tor Phern Chern, who had earlier testified that patients who suffer depression in relation to their work would ""experience impairment"" in areas such as performing their tasks properly. The judge added: ""In the case of the accused, he remarkably continued to go to work diligently during the entire period of offending. ""The accused stopped swopping the luggage tags immediately upon his transfer in February 2017 to an easier job. Dr Tor pointed out that... if the (major depressive disorder) was causing him to do the swopping, he would not have been able to stop immediately."" Tay was deployed to the Explosives Detection System X-ray machine at Belt 5-7 a few weeks after starting work in September 2016. During the hearing, Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiam Jia Min said the machine would stop working several times a day. Whenever there was a breakdown, Tay had to move the bags to another X-ray machine about 6m away. Tay told his supervisor that it was physically tiring work. However, as the company's manpower was limited at the time, the firm did not deploy additional staff. His offences came to light after the airlines told ground handling company Sats that some of their passengers' baggage tags had been tampered with. Sats made a police report on Dec 7, 2016. "
